    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>What Is Education?</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Our ideas of education take too narrow and too
low a range. There is need of a broader scope,
a higher aim. True education means more than the
pursual of a certain course of study. It means more
than a preparation for the life that now is. It has to
do with the whole being, and with the whole period of
existence possible to man. It is the harmonious development
of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual
powers. It prepares the student for the joy of service
in this world, and for the higher joy of wider service in
the world to come.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Its Source</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The source of such an education is brought to view
in these words of Holy Writ, pointing to the Infinite
One: In Him “are hid all the treasures of wisdom.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
“He hath counsel and understanding.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The world has had its great teachers, men of giant
intellect and extensive research, men whose utterances
have stimulated thought, and opened to view vast fields
of knowledge; and these men have been honored as
guides and benefactors of their race; but there is One
who stands higher than they. We can trace the line of
the world’s teachers as far back as human records
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>extend; but the Light was before them. As the moon
and the stars of our solar system shine by the reflected
light of the sun, so, as far as their teaching is true, do
the world’s great thinkers reflect the rays of the Sun of
Righteousness. Every gleam of thought, every flash
of the intellect, is from the Light of the world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The True “Higher Education”</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In these days much is said concerning the nature
and importance of “higher education.” The true
“higher education” is that imparted by Him with
whom “is wisdom and strength;”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> out of whose mouth
“cometh knowledge and understanding.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In a knowledge of God, all true knowledge and real
development have their source. Wherever we turn, in
the physical, the mental, or the spiritual realm; in
whatever we behold, apart from the blight of sin, this
knowledge is revealed. Whatever line of investigation
we pursue, with a sincere purpose to arrive at truth, we
are brought in touch with the unseen, mighty Intelligence
that is working in and through all. The mind of
man is brought into communion with the mind of God,
the finite with the Infinite. The effect of such communion
on body and mind and soul is beyond estimate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Education in Eden</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In this communion is found the highest education.
It is God’s own method of development. “Acquaint
now thyself with Him,”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> is His message to mankind.
The method outlined in these words was the method
followed in the education of the father of our race.
When in the glory of sinless manhood Adam stood
in holy Eden, it was thus that God instructed him.</p>

<p class='c014'>In order to understand what is comprehended in the
work of education, we need to consider both the nature
of man and the purpose of God in creating him. We
need to consider also the change in man’s condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>through the coming in of a knowledge of evil, and
God’s plan for still fulfilling His glorious purpose in the
education of the human race.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>God’s Purpose for Man</i></div>

<p class='c014'>When Adam came from the Creator’s hand, he bore,
in his physical, mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness
to his Maker. “God created man in His own image,”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
and it was His purpose that the longer man lived,  the
more fully he should reveal this image,—the more fully
reflect the glory of the Creator. All his faculties were
capable of development; their capacity and vigor were
continually to increase. Vast was the scope offered for
their exercise; glorious the field opened to their research.
The mysteries of the visible universe—the “wondrous
works of Him who is perfect in knowledge”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>—invited
man’s study. Face-to-face, heart-to-heart
communion with his Maker was his high privilege.
Had he remained loyal to God, all this would have been
his forever. Throughout eternal ages he would have
continued to gain new treasures of knowledge, to discover
fresh springs of happiness, and to obtain clearer
and yet clearer conceptions of the wisdom, the power,
and the love of God. More and more fully would he
have fulfilled the object of his creation, more and more
fully have reflected the Creator’s glory.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Marred and Restored</i></div>

<p class='c014'>But by disobedience this was forfeited. Through
sin the divine likeness was marred, and well-nigh
obliterated. Man’s physical powers were weakened,
his mental capacity was lessened, his spiritual vision
dimmed. He had become subject to death. Yet the
race was not left without hope. By infinite love and
mercy the plan of salvation had been devised, and a life
of probation was granted. To restore in man the image
of his Maker, to bring him back to the perfection in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>which he was created, to promote the development of
body, mind, and soul, that the divine purpose in his
creation might be realized,—this was to be the work of
redemption. This is the object  of education, the great
object of life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Love the Basis of Education</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Love, the basis of creation and of redemption, is the
basis of true education. This is made plain in the law
that God has given as the guide of life. The first and
great commandment is, “Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy strength, and with all thy mind.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> To
love Him, the infinite, the omniscient One, with the
whole strength, and mind, and heart, means the highest
development of every power. It means that in the
whole being—the body, the mind, as well as the soul—the
image of God is to be restored.</p>

<p class='c014'>Like the first is the second commandment,—“Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> The law of
love calls for the devotion of body, mind, and soul
to the service of God and our fellow-men. And this
service, while making us a blessing to others, brings the
greatest blessing to ourselves. Unselfishness underlies
all true development. Through unselfish service we
receive the highest culture of every faculty. More and
more fully do we become partakers of the divine nature.
We are fitted for heaven; for we receive heaven into our
hearts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Revelation of God</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nature’s Teaching Insufficient</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Since God is the source of all true knowledge, it is,
as we have seen, the first object of education to direct
our minds to His own revelation of Himself. Adam
and Eve received knowledge through direct communion
with God; and they learned of Him through His works.
All created things, in their original perfection, were an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>expression of the thought of God. To Adam and Eve
nature was teeming with divine wisdom. But by transgression
man was cut off from learning of God through
direct communion, and, to a great degree, through His
works. The earth, marred and defiled by sin, reflects
but dimly the Creator’s glory. It is true that His object-lessons
are not obliterated. Upon every page of the great
volume of His created works may still be traced His
handwriting. Nature still speaks of her Creator. Yet
these revelations are partial and imperfect. And in our
fallen state, with weakened powers and restricted vision,
we are incapable of interpreting aright. We need the
fuller revelation of Himself that God has given in His
written word.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Standard of Truth</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Holy Scriptures are the perfect standard of
truth, and as such should be given the highest place in
education. To obtain an education worthy of the name,
we must receive a knowledge of God, the Creator, and
of Christ, the Redeemer, as they are revealed in the
sacred word.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Individuality</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Every human being, created in the image of God, is
endowed with a power akin to that of the Creator,—individuality,
power to think and to do. The men in
whom this power is developed are the men who bear
responsibilities, who are leaders in enterprise, and who
influence character. It is the work of true education
to develop this power; to train the youth to be thinkers,
and not mere reflectors of other men’s thought.
Instead of confining their study to that which men have
said or written, let students be directed to the sources of
truth, to the vast fields opened for research in nature
and revelation. Let them contemplate the great facts
of duty and destiny, and the mind will expand and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>strengthen. Instead of educated weaklings, institutions
of learning may send forth men strong to think and to
act, men who are masters and not slaves of circumstances,
men who possess breadth of mind, clearness of
thought, and the courage of their convictions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Character</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Such an education provides more than mental discipline;
it provides more than physical training. It
strengthens the character, so that truth and uprightness
are not sacrificed to selfish desire or worldly ambition.
It fortifies the mind against evil. Instead of some master
passion becoming a power to destroy, every motive and
desire are brought into conformity to the great principles
of right. As the perfection of His character is dwelt
upon, the mind is renewed, and the soul is re-created in
the image of God.</p>

<p class='c014'>What education can be higher than this? What can
equal it in value?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It can not be gotten for gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</div>
      <div class='line'>It can not be valued with the gold of Ophir,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</div>
      <div class='line'>The gold and the crystal can not equal it;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</div>
      <div class='line'>No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls;</div>
      <div class='line'>For the price of wisdom is above rubies.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Highest Ideal</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Higher than the highest human thought can reach
is God’s ideal for His children. Godliness—godlikeness—is
the goal to be reached. Before the student there is
opened a path of continual progress. He has an object
to achieve, a standard to attain, that includes everything
good, and pure, and noble. He will advance as fast
and as far as possible in every branch of true knowledge.
But his efforts will be directed to objects as much higher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>than mere selfish and temporal interests as the heavens
are higher than the earth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Preparatory School</i></div>

<p class='c014'>He who co-operates with the divine purpose in imparting
to the youth a knowledge of God, and moulding
the character into harmony with His, does a high and
noble work. As he awakens a desire to reach God’s
ideal, he presents an education that is as high as heaven
and as broad as the universe; an education that can not
be completed in his life, but that will be continued in
the life to come; an education that secures to the
successful student his passport from the preparatory
school of earth to the higher grade, the school above.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Model School</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The system of education instituted at the beginning
of the world, was to be a model for man throughout
all after-time. As an illustration of its principles a
model school was established in Eden, the home of our
first parents. The garden of Eden was the schoolroom,
nature was the lesson-book, the Creator Himself was
the instructor, and the parents of the human family were
the students.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Students</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Created to be “the image and glory of God,” Adam
and Eve had received endowments not unworthy of
their high destiny. Graceful and symmetrical in form,
regular and beautiful in feature, their countenances
glowing with the tint of health and the light of joy and
hope, they bore in outward resemblance the likeness of
their Maker. Nor was this likeness manifest in the
physical nature only. Every faculty of mind and soul
reflected the Creator’s glory. Endowed with high
mental and spiritual gifts, Adam and Eve were made
but “little lower than the angels,”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> that they might not
only discern the wonders of the visible universe, but
comprehend moral responsibilities and obligations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Schoolroom</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden;
and there He put the man whom He had formed. And
out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food;
the tree of life also in the midst of the garden.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
Here, amidst the beautiful scenes of nature untouched
by sin, our first parents were to receive their education.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Teacher</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In His interest for His children, our heavenly Father
personally directed their education. Often they were
visited by His messengers, the holy angels, and from
them received counsel and instruction. Often as they
walked in the garden in the cool of the day they heard
the voice of God, and face to face held communion
with the Eternal. His thoughts toward them were
“thoughts of peace, and not of evil.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> His every
purpose was their highest good.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Course of Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'>To Adam and Eve was committed the care of the
garden, “to dress it and to keep it.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Though
rich in all that the Owner of the universe could
supply, they were not to be idle. Useful occupation
was appointed them as a blessing, to strengthen the
body, to expand the mind, and to develop the character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Original Research</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The book of nature, which spread its living lessons
before them, afforded an exhaustless source of instruction
and delight. On every leaf of the forest and stone
of the mountains, in every shining star, in earth and sea
and sky, God’s name was written. With both the
animate and the inanimate creation,—with leaf and
flower and tree, and with every living creature, from
the leviathan of the waters to the mote in the sunbeam,—the
dwellers in Eden held converse, gathering from
each the secrets of its life. God’s glory in the heavens,
the innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions,
“the balancings of the clouds,”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a> the mysteries of light
and sound, of day and night,—all were objects of study
by the pupils of earth’s first school.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The laws and operations of nature, and the great
principles of truth that govern the spiritual universe,
were opened to their minds by the infinite Author of
all. In “the light of the knowledge of the glory of
God,”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> their mental and spiritual powers developed,
and they realized the highest pleasures of their holy
existence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Other Schools</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Purpose of Training</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As it came from the Creator’s hand, not only the
garden of Eden but the whole earth was exceedingly
beautiful. No taint of sin, or shadow of death, marred
the fair creation. God’s glory “covered the heavens,
and the earth was full of His praise.” “The morning
stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted
for joy.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Thus was the earth a fit emblem of
Him who is “abundant in goodness and truth;”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a> a fit
study for those who were made in His image. The
garden of Eden was a representation of what God
desired the whole earth to become, and it was His
purpose that, as the human family increased in numbers,
they should establish other homes and schools
like the one He had given. Thus in course of time
the whole earth might be occupied with homes and
schools where the words and the works of God
should be studied, and where the students should
thus be fitted more and more fully to reflect, throughout
endless ages, the light of the knowledge of His
glory.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Test of Loyalty</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Though created innocent and holy, our first parents
were not placed beyond the possibility of wrong-doing.
God might have created them without the power
to transgress His requirements; but in that case there
could have been no development of character; their service
would not have been voluntary, but forced. Therefore
He gave them the power of choice—the power to
yield or to withhold obedience. And before they could
receive in fulness the blessings He desired to impart,
their love and loyalty must be tested.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Only Evil Withheld</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the garden of Eden was the “tree of knowledge
of good and evil.... And the Lord God
commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
It was the will of God that Adam and Eve should not
know evil. The knowledge of good had been freely
given them; but the knowledge of evil,—of sin and its
results, of wearing toil, of anxious care, of disappointment
and grief, of pain and death,—this was in love
withheld.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Insinuation of Distrust</i></div>

<p class='c014'>While God was seeking man’s good, Satan was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>seeking his ruin. When Eve, disregarding the Lord’s
admonition concerning the forbidden tree, ventured to
approach it, she came in contact with her foe. Her
interest and curiosity having been awakened, Satan proceeded
to deny God’s word, and to insinuate distrust of
His wisdom and goodness. To the woman’s statement
concerning the tree of knowledge, “God hath said, Ye
shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die,”
the tempter made answer, “Ye shall not surely die; for
God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing
good and evil.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Reason versus Faith</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Satan desired to make it appear that this knowledge
of good mingled with evil would be a blessing, and that
in forbidding them to take of the fruit of the tree, God
was withholding great good. He urged that it was
because of its wonderful properties for imparting wisdom
and power that God had forbidden them to taste it; that
He was thus seeking to prevent them from reaching a
nobler development and finding greater happiness. He
declared that he himself had eaten of the forbidden fruit,
and as a result had acquired the power of speech; and
that if they also would eat of it, they would attain to a
more exalted sphere of existence, and enter a broader
field of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c014'>While Satan claimed to have received great good by
eating of the forbidden tree, he did not let it appear that
by transgression he had become an outcast from heaven.
Here was falsehood, so concealed under a covering of
apparent truth that Eve, infatuated, flattered, beguiled,
did not discern the deception. She coveted what God
had forbidden; she distrusted His wisdom. She cast
away faith, the key of knowledge.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sight versus God’s Word</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>When Eve saw “that the tree was good for food,
and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof,
and did eat.” It was grateful to the taste, and, as she
ate, she seemed to feel a vivifying power, and imagined
herself entering upon a higher state of existence. Having
herself transgressed, she became a tempter to her
husband, “and he did eat.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“Your eyes shall be opened,” the enemy had said;
“ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Their
eyes were indeed opened; but how sad the opening!
The knowledge of evil, the curse of sin, was all that
the transgressors gained. There was nothing poisonous
in the fruit itself, and the sin was not merely in yielding
to appetite. It was distrust of God’s goodness, disbelief
of His word, and rejection of His authority, that made
our first parents transgressors, and that brought into
the world a knowledge of evil. It was this that opened
the door to every species of falsehood and error.</p>

<p class='c014'>Man lost all because he chose to listen to the
deceiver rather than to Him who is Truth, who alone
has understanding. By the mingling of evil with good,
his mind had become confused, his mental and spiritual
powers benumbed. No longer could he appreciate the
good that God had so freely bestowed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Results of Sin</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Adam and Eve had chosen the knowledge of evil;
and if they ever regained the position they had lost,
they must regain it under the unfavorable conditions
they had brought upon themselves. No longer were
they to dwell in Eden; for in its perfection it could not
teach them the lessons which it was now essential for
them to learn. In unutterable sadness they bade farewell
to their beautiful surroundings, and went forth to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>dwell upon the earth, where rested the curse of sin.</p>

<p class='c014'>To Adam God had said: “Because thou hast harkened
unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the
tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not
eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow
shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns also
and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt
eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy face shalt
thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out
of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust
shalt thou return.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Results Manifest in Nature</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Although the earth was blighted with the curse,
nature was still to be man’s lesson-book. It could not
now represent goodness only; for evil was everywhere
present, marring earth and sea and air with its defiling
touch. Where once was written only the character of
God, the knowledge of good, was now written also the
character of Satan, the knowledge of evil. From nature,
which now revealed the knowledge of good and evil,
man was continually to receive warning as to the results
of sin.</p>

<p class='c014'>In drooping flower and falling leaf Adam and his
companion witnessed the first signs of decay. Vividly
was brought to their minds the stern fact that every
living thing must die. Even the air, upon which their
life depended, bore the seeds of death.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Lost Kingship</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Continually they were reminded also of their lost
dominion. Among the lower creatures Adam had stood
as king, and so long as he remained loyal to God, all
nature acknowledged his rule; but when he transgressed,
this dominion was forfeited. The spirit of rebellion, to
which he himself had given entrance, extended throughout
the animal creation. Thus not only the life of man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>but the nature of the beasts, the trees of the forest, the
grass of the field, the very air he breathed, all told the
sad lesson of the knowledge of evil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Restoration through Christ</i></div>

<p class='c014'>But man was not abandoned to the results of the
evil he had chosen. In the sentence pronounced upon
Satan was given an intimation of redemption. “I will
put enmity between thee and the woman,” God said,
“and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise
thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> This sentence,
spoken in the hearing of our first parents, was to
them a promise. Before they heard of the thorn and
the thistle, of the toil and sorrow that must be their
portion, or of the dust to which they must return, they
listened to words that could not fail of giving them
hope. All that had been lost by yielding to Satan
could be regained through Christ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Gospel in Nature</i></div>

<p class='c014'>This intimation also nature repeats to us. Though
marred by sin, it speaks not only of creation but of
redemption. Though the earth bears testimony to the
curse in the evident signs of decay, it is still rich and
beautiful in the tokens of life-giving power. The trees
cast off their leaves, only to be robed with fresher
verdure; the flowers die, to spring forth in new beauty;
and in every manifestation of creative power is held out
the assurance that we may be created anew in “righteousness
and holiness of truth.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Thus the very objects
and operations of nature that bring so vividly to
mind our great loss become to us the messengers of
hope.</p>

<p class='c014'>As far as evil extends, the voice of our Father is
heard, bidding His children see in its results the nature
of sin, warning them to forsake the evil, and inviting
them to receive the good.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Communion with God</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>By sin man was shut out from God. Except for
the plan of redemption, eternal separation from
God, the darkness of unending night, would have been
his. Through the Saviour’s sacrifice, communion with
God is again made possible. We may not in person
approach into His presence; in our sin we may not
look upon His face; but we can behold Him and commune
with Him in Jesus, the Saviour. “The light of
the knowledge of the glory of God” is revealed “in
the face of Jesus Christ.” God is “in Christ, reconciling
the world unto Himself.”<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Highest Revelation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us,&nbsp;... full of grace and  truth.” “In Him was life;
and the life was the light of men.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a> The life and
the death of Christ, the price of our redemption, are
not only to us the promise and pledge of life, not
only the means of opening again to us the treasures
of wisdom: they are a broader, higher revelation of His
character than even the holy ones of Eden knew.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Power through the Gospel</i></div>

<p class='c014'>And while Christ opens heaven to man, the life
which He imparts opens the heart of man to heaven.
Sin not only shuts us away from God, but destroys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>in the human soul both the desire and the capacity for
knowing Him. All this work of evil it is Christ’s
mission to undo. The faculties of the soul, paralyzed
by sin, the darkened mind, the perverted will, He has
power to invigorate and to restore. He opens to us
the riches of the universe, and by Him the power to
discern and to appropriate these treasures is imparted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Co-operation with Christ</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Christ is the “Light, which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world.”<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a> As through Christ every
human being has life, so also through Him every soul
receives some ray of divine light. Not only intellectual
but spiritual power, a perception of right, a desire
for goodness, exists in every heart. But against these
principles there is struggling an antagonistic power.
The result of the eating of the tree of knowledge of
good and evil is manifest in every man’s experience.
There is in his nature a bent to evil, a force which,
unaided, he can not resist. To withstand this force,
to attain that ideal which in his inmost soul he accepts
as alone worthy, he can find help in but one power.
That power is Christ. Co-operation with that power
is man’s greatest need. In all educational effort should
not this co-operation be the highest aim?</p>

<p class='c014'>The true teacher is not satisfied with second-rate
work. He is not satisfied with directing his students
to a standard lower than the highest which it is possible
for them to attain. He can not be content with
imparting to them only technical knowledge, with
making them merely clever accountants, skilful artisans,
successful tradesmen. It is his ambition to inspire
them with principles of truth, obedience, honor, integrity,
and purity,—principles that will make them a
positive force for the stability and uplifting of society.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>He desires them, above all else, to learn life’s great
lesson of unselfish service.</p>

<p class='c014'>These principles become a living power to shape
the character, through the acquaintance of the soul
with Christ; through an acceptance of His wisdom as
the guide, His power as the strength, of heart and
life. This union formed, the student has found the
Source of wisdom. He has within his reach the power
to realize in himself his noblest ideals. The opportunities
of the highest education for life in his world
are his. And in the training here gained, he is entering
upon that course which embraces eternity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The One Foundation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the highest sense, the work of education and the
work of redemption are one; for in education, as in
redemption, “other foundation can no man lay than
that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” “It was the good
pleasure of the Father that in Him should all the
fulness dwell.”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Under changed conditions, true education is still
conformed to the Creator’s plan, the plan of the Eden
school. Adam and Eve received instruction through
direct communion with God; we behold “the light of
the knowledge of His glory” in the face of Christ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Teacher’s Aim</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The great principles of education are unchanged.
“They stand fast forever and ever;”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a> for they are the
principles of the character of God. To aid the student
in comprehending these principles, and in entering into
that relation with Christ which will make them a controlling
power in the life, should be the teacher’s first
effort and his constant aim. The teacher who accepts
this aim is in  truth a co-worker with Christ, a laborer
together with God.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The system of education established in Eden centered
in the family. Adam was “the son of
God,”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a> and it was from their Father that the children of
the Highest received instruction. Theirs, in the truest
sense, was a family school.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Family School</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the divine plan of education as adapted to man’s
condition after the fall, Christ stands as the representative
of the Father, the connecting link between God and
man; He is the great teacher of mankind. And He
ordained that men and women should be His representatives.
The family was the school, and the parents
were the teachers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Conditions</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The education centering in the family was that
which prevailed in the days of the patriarchs. For
the schools thus established, God provided the conditions
most favorable for the development of character.
The people who were under His direction still pursued
the plan of life that He had appointed in the beginning.
Those who departed from God built for themselves
cities, and, congregating in them, gloried in the splendor,
the luxury, and the vice that make the cities of
to-day the world’s pride and its curse. But the men
who held fast God’s principles of life dwelt among the
fields and hills. They were tillers of the soil, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>keepers of flocks and herds; and in this free, independent
life, with its opportunities for labor and study and meditation,
they learned of God, and taught their children of
His works and ways.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Training in the Wilderness</i></div>

<p class='c014'>This was the method of education that God desired
to establish in Israel. But when brought out of
Egypt there were among the Israelites few prepared to
be workers together with Him in the training of their
children. The parents themselves needed instruction
and discipline. Victims of lifelong slavery, they were
ignorant, untrained, degraded. They had little knowledge
of God, and little faith in Him. They were confused
by false teaching, and corrupted by their long
contact with heathenism. God desired to lift them to
a higher moral level; and to this end He sought to
give them a knowledge of Himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>To Encourage Faith</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In His dealings with the wanderers in the desert,
in all their marchings to and fro, in their exposure
to hunger, thirst, and weariness, in their peril from
heathen foes, and in the manifestation of His providence
for their relief, God was seeking to strengthen their
faith by revealing to them the power that was continually
working for their good. And having taught them
to trust in His love and power, it was His purpose to
set before them, in the precepts of His law, the standard
of character to which, through His grace, He desired
them to attain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Surroundings at Sinai</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>The Strength of the Hills Is His</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>Precious were the lessons taught to Israel during
their sojourn at Sinai. This was a period of special
training for the inheritance of Canaan. And their surroundings
here were favorable for the accomplishing of
God’s purpose. On the summit of Sinai, overshadowing
the plain where the people spread their tents, rested the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>pillar of cloud which had been the guide of their
journey. A pillar of fire by night, it assured them of
the divine protection; and while they were locked in
slumber, the bread of heaven fell gently upon the
encampment. On every hand, vast, rugged heights,
in their solemn grandeur, spoke of eternal endurance
and majesty. Man was made to feel his ignorance and
weakness in the presence of Him who hath “weighed
the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
Here, by the manifestation of His glory, God sought
to impress Israel with the holiness of His character and
requirements, and the exceeding guilt of transgression.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Symbol of God’s Presence</i></div>

<p class='c014'>But the people were slow to learn the lesson.
Accustomed as they had been in Egypt to material
representations of the Deity, and these of the most
degrading nature, it was difficult for them to conceive
of the existence or the character of the Unseen One.
In pity for their weakness, God gave them a symbol of
His presence. “Let them make Me a sanctuary,” He
said; “that I may dwell among them.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In the building of the sanctuary as a dwelling-place
for God, Moses was directed to make all things according
to the pattern of things in the heavens. God called
him into the mount, and revealed to him the heavenly
things, and in their similitude the tabernacle, with all
that pertained to it, was fashioned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Pattern in the Mount</i></div>

<p class='c014'>So to Israel, whom He desired to make His dwelling-place,
He revealed His glorious ideal of character. The
pattern was shown them in the mount when the law
was given from Sinai, and when God passed by before
Moses and proclaimed, “The Lord, The Lord God,
merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in
goodness and truth.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>But this ideal they were, in themselves, powerless
to attain. The revelation at Sinai could only impress
them with their need and helplessness. Another lesson
the tabernacle, through its service of sacrifice, was to
teach,—the lesson of pardon of sin, and power through
the Saviour for obedience unto life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Gospel in the Tabernacle</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Through Christ was to be fulfilled the purpose
of which the tabernacle was a symbol,—that glorious
building, its walls of glistening gold reflecting in rainbow
hues the curtains inwrought with cherubim, the
fragrance of ever-burning incense pervading all, the
priests robed in spotless white, and in the deep mystery
of the inner place, above the mercy-seat, between the
figures of the bowed, worshiping angels, the glory of
the Holiest. In all, God desired His people to read
His purpose for the human soul. It was the same
purpose long afterward set forth by the apostle Paul,
speaking by the Holy Spirit:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Human Temple</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and
that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man
defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for
the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Building the Sanctuary</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Great was the privilege and honor granted Israel
in the preparation of the sanctuary; and great was also
the responsibility. A structure of surpassing splendor,
demanding for its construction the most costly material
and the highest artistic skill, was to be erected in the
wilderness, by a people just escaped from slavery. It
seemed a stupendous task. But He who had given the
plan of the building stood pledged to co-operate with the
builders.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, See, I have
called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of the tribe of Judah; and I have filled him with the
Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in
knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship....
And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son
of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of
all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they
may make all that I have commanded thee.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>An Industrial School</i></div>

<p class='c014'>What an industrial school was that in the wilderness,
having for its instructors Christ and His angels!</p>

<p class='c014'>In the preparation of the sanctuary and in its furnishing,
all the people were to co-operate. There was
labor for brain and hand. A great variety of material
was required, and all were invited to contribute as their
own hearts prompted.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus in labor and in giving they were taught to
co-operate with God and with one another. And they
were to co-operate also in the preparation of the spiritual
building—God’s temple in the soul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Organization</i></div>

<p class='c014'>From the outset of the journey from Egypt, lessons
had been given for their training and discipline. Even
before they left Egypt a temporary organization had
been effected, and the people were arranged in companies,
under appointed leaders. At Sinai the arrangements for
organization were completed. The order so strikingly
displayed in all the works of God was manifest in the
Hebrew economy. God was the center of authority
and government. Moses, as His representative, was
to administer the laws in His name. Then came the
council of seventy, then the priests and the princes,
under these “captains over thousands, and captains over
hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over
tens,”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a> and, lastly, officers appointed for special duties.
The camp was arranged in exact order, the tabernacle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the abiding-place of God, in the midst, and around it
the tents of the priests and the Levites. Outside of these,
each tribe encamped beside its own standard.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sanitary Regulations</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Thorough-going sanitary regulations were enforced.
These were enjoined on the people, not only as necessary
to health, but as the condition of retaining among them
the presence of the Holy One. By divine authority
Moses declared to them, “The Lord thy God walketh in
the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee;&nbsp;... therefore
shall thy camp be holy.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Diet</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The education of the Israelites included all their
habits of life. Everything that concerned their well-being
was the subject of divine solicitude, and came
within the province of divine law. Even in providing
their food, God sought their highest good. The manna
with which He fed them in the wilderness was of a
nature to promote physical, mental, and moral strength.
Though so many of them rebelled against the restriction
of their diet, and longed to return to the days when,
they said, “We sat by the flesh-pots, and when we did
eat bread to the full,”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a> yet the wisdom of God’s choice
for them was vindicated in a manner they could not
gainsay. Notwithstanding the hardships of their wilderness
life, there was not a feeble one in all their tribes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Divine Guiding</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In all their journeyings the ark containing the law
of God was to lead the way. The place of their encampment
was indicated by the descent of the pillar of cloud.
As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they
remained in camp. When it lifted, they pursued their
journey. Both the halt and the departure were marked
by a solemn invocation. “It came to pass, when the
ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let
Thine enemies be scattered.... And when it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands
of Israel.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Music and Song</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As the people journeyed through the wilderness,
many precious lessons were fixed in their minds by
means of song. At their deliverance from Pharaoh’s
army the whole host of Israel had joined in the song
of triumph. Far over desert and sea rang the joyous
refrain, and the mountains re-echoed the accents of
praise, “Sing ye to Jehovah, for He hath triumphed
gloriously.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Often on the journey was this song
repeated, cheering the hearts and kindling the faith of
the pilgrim travelers. The commandments as given
from Sinai, with promises of God’s favor and records
of His wonderful works for their deliverance, were by
divine direction expressed in song, and were chanted to
the sound of instrumental music, the people keeping
step as their voices united in praise.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus their thoughts were uplifted from the trials
and difficulties of the way, the restless, turbulent spirit
was soothed and calmed, the principles of truth were
implanted in the memory, and faith was strengthened.
Concert of action taught order and unity, and the people
were brought into closer touch with God and with one
another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Purpose of God’s Discipline</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Of the dealing of God with Israel during the forty
years of wilderness wandering, Moses declared: “As a
man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth
thee;” “to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know
what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldst keep
His commandments, or no.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“He found him in a desert land, and in the waste
howling wilderness; He led him about, He instructed
him, He kept him as the apple of His eye. As an eagle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth
abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her
wings; so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was
no strange god with him.”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“He remembered His holy promise, and Abraham
His servant. And He brought forth His people with
joy, and His chosen with gladness; and gave them the
lands of the heathen; and they inherited the labor of
the people; that they might observe His statutes, and
keep His laws.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Facilities in Canaan</i></div>

<p class='c014'>God surrounded Israel with every facility, gave them
every privilege, that would make them an honor to His
name and a blessing to surrounding nations. If they
would walk in the ways of obedience, He promised to
make them “high above all nations which He hath
made, in praise, and in name, and in honor.” “All people
of the earth,” He said, “shall hear that thou art
called by the name of Jehovah; and they shall be afraid
of thee.” The nations which shall hear all these statutes
shall say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and
understanding people.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>God’s Law Taught</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the laws committed to Israel, explicit instruction
was given concerning education. To Moses at Sinai
God had revealed Himself as “merciful and gracious,
long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
These principles, embodied in His law, the fathers and
mothers in Israel were to teach their children. Moses
by divine direction declared to them: “These words,
which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart;
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine
house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when
thou liest down, and when thou risest up.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Not as a dry theory were these things to be taught.
Those who would impart truth must themselves practise
its principles. Only by reflecting the character of God
in the uprightness, nobility, and unselfishness of their
own lives can they impress others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Object Lessons</i></div>

<p class='c014'>True education is not the forcing of instruction on
an unready and unreceptive mind. The mental powers
must be awakened, the interest aroused. For this, God’s
method of teaching provided. He who created the
mind and ordained its laws, provided for its development
in accordance with them. In the home and the
sanctuary, through the things of nature and of art, in
labor and in festivity, in sacred building and memorial
stone, by methods and rites and symbols unnumbered,
God gave to Israel lessons illustrating His principles,
and preserving the memory of His wonderful works.
Then, as inquiry was made, the instruction given
impressed mind and heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the arrangements for the education of the chosen
people it is made manifest that a life centered in God is
a life of completeness. Every want He has implanted,
He provides to satisfy; every faculty imparted, He seeks
to develop.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Author of all beauty, Himself a lover of the
beautiful, God provided to gratify in His children the
love of beauty. He made provision also for their social
needs, for the kindly and helpful associations that do
so much to cultivate sympathy and to brighten and
sweeten life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Annual Feasts</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As a means of education, an important place was
filled by the feasts of Israel. In ordinary life the family
was both a school and a church, the parents being
the instructors in secular and in religious lines. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>three times a year seasons were appointed for social intercourse
and worship. First at Shiloh, and afterward
at Jerusalem, these gatherings were held. Only the
fathers and sons were required to be present; but none
desired to forego the opportunities of the feasts, and,
so far as possible, all the household were in attendance;
and with them, as sharers of their hospitality, were the
stranger, the Levite, and the poor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Journey to Jerusalem</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The journey to Jerusalem, in the simple, patriarchal
style, amidst the beauty of the spring-time, the richness
of midsummer, or the ripened glory of autumn, was a
delight. With offerings of gratitude they came, from
the man of white hairs to the little child, to meet with
God in His holy habitation. As they journeyed, the
experiences of the past, the stories that both old and
young still love so well, were recounted to the Hebrew
children. The songs that had cheered the wilderness
wandering were sung. God’s commandments were
chanted, and, bound up with the blessed influences of
nature and of kindly human association, they were forever
fixed in the memory of many a child and youth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Paschal Service</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The ceremonies witnessed at Jerusalem in connection
with the paschal service,—the night assembly, the
men with their girded loins, shoes on feet, and staff in
hand, the hasty meal, the lamb, the unleavened bread,
and the bitter herbs, and in the solemn silence the
rehearsal of the story of the sprinkled blood, the death-dealing
angel, and the grand march from the land of
bondage,—all were of a nature to stir the imagination
and impress the heart.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Feast of Ingathering</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Feast of Tabernacles, or harvest-festival, with
its offerings from orchard and field, its week’s encampment
in the leafy booths, its social reunions, the sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>memorial service, and the generous hospitality to God’s
workers, the Levites of the sanctuary, and to His children,
the strangers and the poor, uplifted all minds in
gratitude to Him who had “crowned the year with His
goodness,” and whose “paths dropped fatness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>By the devout in Israel, fully a month of every year
was occupied in this way. It was a period free from
care and labor, and almost wholly devoted, in the truest
sense, to purposes of education.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ownership of Land</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In apportioning the inheritance of His people, it
was God’s purpose to teach them, and through them
the people of after-generations, correct principles concerning
the ownership of the land. The land of Canaan
was divided among the whole people, the Levites only,
as ministers of the sanctuary, being excepted. Though
one might for a season dispose of his possession, he
could not barter away the inheritance of his children.
When able to do so, he was at liberty at any time to
redeem it; debts were remitted every seventh year, and
in the fiftieth, or year of jubilee, all landed property
reverted to the original owner. Thus every family was
secured in its possession, and a safeguard was afforded
against the extremes either of wealth or of poverty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Special Provision for Education</i></div>

<p class='c014'>By the distribution of the land among the people,
God provided for them, as for the dwellers in Eden, the
occupation most favorable to development,—the care of
plants and animals. A further provision for education
was the suspension of agricultural labor every seventh
year, the land lying fallow, and its spontaneous products
being left to the poor. Thus was given opportunity
for more extended study, for social intercourse
and worship, and for the exercise of benevolence, so
often crowded out by life’s cares and labors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Key to Present-Day Problems</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Were the principles of God’s laws regarding the
distribution of property carried out in the world to-day,
how different would be the condition of the people!
An observance of these principles would prevent the
terrible evils that in all ages have resulted from the
oppression of the poor by the rich and the hatred of
the rich by the poor. While it might hinder the
amassing of great wealth, it would tend to prevent
the ignorance and degradation of tens of thousands
whose ill-paid servitude is required for the building up
of these colossal fortunes. It would aid in bringing a
peaceful solution of problems that now threaten to fill
the world with anarchy and bloodshed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Recognition of God’s Ownership</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The consecration to God of a tithe of all increase,
whether of the orchard and harvest-field, the flocks and
herds, or the labor of brain or hand; the devotion of a
second tithe for the relief of the poor and other benevolent
uses, tended to keep fresh before the people the
truth of God’s ownership of all, and of their opportunity
to be channels of His blessings. It was a training
adapted to kill out all narrowing selfishness, and to
cultivate breadth and nobility of character.</p>

<p class='c014'>A knowledge of God, fellowship with Him in study
and in labor, likeness to Him in character, were to be
the source, the means, and the aim of Israel’s education,—the
education imparted by God to the parents, and by
them to be given to their children.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Perils from Heathenism</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Wherever in Israel God’s plan of education
was carried into effect, its results testified of its
Author. But in very many households the training appointed
by Heaven, and the characters thus developed,
were alike rare. God’s plan was but partially and
imperfectly fulfilled. By unbelief and by disregard of the
Lord’s directions, the Israelites surrounded themselves
with temptations that few had power to resist. At their
settlement in Canaan “they did not destroy the nations,
concerning whom the Lord commanded them; but
were mingled among the heathen, and learned their
works. And they served their idols, which were a
snare unto them.” Their heart was not right with
God, “neither were they steadfast in His covenant.
But He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity,
and destroyed them not; yea, many a time turned He
His anger away.... For He remembered that
they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh
not again.”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Parental Indifference</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Fathers and mothers in Israel became
indifferent to their obligation to God, indifferent to their
obligation to their children. Through unfaithfulness in
the home, and idolatrous influences without, many of
the Hebrew youth received an education differing widely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>from that which God had planned for them. They
learned the ways of the heathen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Schools as a Safeguard</i></div>

<p class='c014'>To meet this growing evil, God provided other
agencies as an aid to parents in the work of education.
From the earliest times, prophets had been recognized
as teachers divinely appointed. In the highest sense
the prophet was one who spoke by direct inspiration,
communicating to the people the messages he had
received from God. But the name was given also to
those who, though not so directly inspired, were
divinely called to instruct the people in the works and
ways of God. For the training of such a class of
teachers, Samuel, by the Lord’s direction, established
the schools of the prophets.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Teachers and Students</i></div>

<p class='c014'>These schools were intended to serve as a barrier
against the wide-spreading corruption, to provide for
the mental and spiritual welfare of the youth, and to
promote the prosperity of the nation by furnishing it
with men qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders
and counselors. To this end, Samuel gathered companies
of young men who were pious, intelligent, and
studious. These were called the sons of the prophets.
As they studied the word and the works of God, His
life-giving power quickened the energies of mind and
soul, and the students received wisdom from above.
The instructors were not only versed in divine truth,
but had themselves enjoyed communion with God, and
had received the special endowment of His Spirit. They
had the respect and confidence of the people, both for
learning and for piety. In Samuel’s day there were
two of these schools,—one at Ramah, the home of the
prophet, and the other at Kirjath-jearim. In later times
others were established.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Industrial Training</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The pupils of these schools sustained themselves by
their own labor in tilling the soil, or in some mechanical
employment. In Israel this was not thought strange or
degrading; indeed, it was regarded as a sin to allow
children to grow up in ignorance of useful labor. Every
youth, whether his parents were rich or poor, was
taught some trade. Even though he was to be educated
for holy office, a knowledge of practical life was regarded
as essential to the greatest usefulness. Many also of the
teachers supported themselves by manual labor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Course of Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In both the school and the home much of the teaching
was oral; but the youth also learned to read the
Hebrew writings, and the parchment rolls of the Old
Testament Scriptures were open to their study. The
chief subjects of study in these schools were the law of
God, with the instruction given to Moses, sacred history,
sacred music, and poetry. In the records of sacred history
were traced the footsteps of Jehovah. The great
truths set forth by the types in the service of the sanctuary
were brought to view, and faith grasped the central
object of all that system,—the Lamb of God, that was to
take away the sin of the world. A spirit of devotion
was cherished. Not only were the students taught the
duty of prayer, but they were taught how to pray, how
to approach their Creator, how to exercise faith in
Him, and how to understand and obey the teachings of
His Spirit. Sanctified intellect brought forth from the
treasure-house of God things new and old, and the Spirit
of God was manifested in prophecy and sacred song.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Results</i></div>

<p class='c014'>These schools proved to be one of the means most
effective in promoting that righteousness which “exalteth
a nation.”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a> In not small degree they aided
in laying the foundation of that marvelous prosperity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>which distinguished the reigns of David and Solomon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>David and Solomon</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The principles taught in the schools of the prophets
were the same that moulded David’s character and
shaped his life. The word of God was his instructor.
“Through Thy precepts,” he said, “I get understanding....
I have inclined mine heart to perform Thy
statutes.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a> It was this that caused the Lord to pronounce
David, when in his youth He called him to the
throne, “a man after Mine own heart.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In the early life of Solomon also are seen the results
of God’s method of education. Solomon in his youth
made David’s choice his own. Above every earthly
good he asked of God a wise and understanding heart.
And the Lord gave him not only that which he sought,
but that also for which he had not sought,—both riches
and honor. The power of his understanding, the extent
of his knowledge, the glory of his reign, became the
wonder of the world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Greatness of Israel</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the reigns of David and Solomon, Israel reached
the height of her greatness. The promise given to
Abraham and repeated through Moses was fulfilled: “If
ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which
I command you, to do them, to love the Lord your
God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave unto Him;
then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before
you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier
than yourselves. Every place whereon the soles of your
feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and
Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto
the uttermost sea shall your coast be. There shall no
man be able to stand before you.”<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Intermingling with Idolaters</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Apostasy</i></div>

<p class='c014'>But in the midst of prosperity lurked danger. The
sin of David’s later years, though sincerely repented of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and sorely punished, emboldened the people in transgression
of God’s commandments. And Solomon’s
life, after a morning of so great promise, was darkened
with apostasy. Desire for political power and self-aggrandizement
led to alliance with heathen nations.
The silver of Tarshish and the gold of Ophir were procured
by the sacrifice of integrity, the betrayal of sacred
trusts. Association with idolaters, marriage with heathen
wives, corrupted his faith. The barriers that God had
erected for the safety of His people were thus broken
down, and Solomon gave himself up to the worship of
false gods. On the summit of the Mount of Olives,
confronting the temple of Jehovah, were erected gigantic
images and altars for the service of heathen deities.
As he cast off his allegiance to God, Solomon lost the
mastery of himself. His fine sensibilities became blunted.
The conscientious, considerate spirit of his early reign
was changed. Pride, ambition, prodigality, and indulgence
bore fruit in cruelty and exaction. He who had
been a just, compassionate, and God-fearing ruler, became
tyrannical and oppressive. He who at the dedication
of the temple had prayed for his people that their
hearts might be undividedly given to the Lord, became
their seducer. Solomon dishonored himself, dishonored
Israel, and dishonored God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>National Overthrow</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The nation, of which he had been the pride, followed
his leading. Though he afterward repented, his repentance
did not prevent the fruition of the evil he had
sown. The discipline and training that God appointed
for Israel would cause them, in all their ways of life, to
differ from the people of other nations. This peculiarity,
which should have been regarded as a special
privilege and blessing, was to them unwelcome. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>simplicity and self-restraint essential to the highest development
they sought to exchange for the pomp and self-indulgence
of heathen peoples. To be “like all the
nations”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a> was their ambition. God’s plan of education
was set aside, His authority disowned.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the rejection of the ways of God for the ways of
men, the downfall of Israel began. Thus also it continued,
until the Jewish people became a prey to the
very nations whose practises they had chosen to follow.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>God’s Plan Unchanged</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As a nation the children of Israel failed of receiving
the benefits that God desired to give them. They did
not appreciate His purpose or co-operate in its execution.
But though individuals and peoples may thus separate
themselves from Him, His purpose for those who trust
Him is unchanged. “Whatsoever God doeth, it shall
be forever.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>While there are different degrees of development and
different manifestations of His power to meet the wants
of men in the different ages, God’s work in all time is
the same. The Teacher is the same. God’s character
and His plan are the same. With Him “is not variableness,
neither shadow of turning.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>For Our Admonition</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>The experiences of Israel were recorded for our
instruction. “All those things happened unto them for
ensamples, and they are written for our admonition, upon
whom the ends of the world are come.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a> With us, as
with Israel of old, success in education depends on
fidelity in carrying out the Creator’s plan. Adherence
to the principles of God’s word will bring as great
blessings to us as it would have brought to the Hebrew
people.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Sacred history presents many illustrations of the
results of true education. It presents many noble
examples of men whose characters were formed under
divine direction; men whose lives were a blessing to
their fellow-men, and who stood in the world as representatives
of God. Among these are Joseph and Daniel,
Moses, Elisha, and Paul,—the greatest statesmen, the
wisest legislator, one of the most faithful of reformers,
and, except Him who spoke as never man spake, the
most illustrious teacher that his world has known.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Joseph</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In early life, just as they were passing from youth
to manhood, Joseph and Daniel were separated from
their homes, and carried as captives to heathen lands.
Especially was Joseph subject to the temptations that
attend great changes of fortune. In his father’s home a
tenderly cherished child; in the house of Potiphar a
slave, then a confidant and companion; a man of affairs,
educated by study, observation, contact with men; in
Pharaoh’s dungeon a prisoner of state, condemned unjustly,
without hope of vindication or prospect of release;
called at a great crisis to the leadership of the nation,—what
enabled him to preserve his integrity?</p>

places of success and honor. But Joseph bore alike
the test of adversity and of prosperity. The same
fidelity was manifest in the palace of the Pharaohs as
in the prisoner’s cell.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Joseph’s Early Years</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In his childhood, Joseph had been taught the love
and fear of God. Often in his father’s tent, under the
Syrian stars, he had been told the story of the night
vision at Bethel, of the ladder from heaven to earth, and
the descending and ascending angels, and of Him who
from the throne above revealed Himself to Jacob. He
had been told the story of the conflict beside the
Jabbok, when, renouncing cherished sins, Jacob stood
conqueror, and received the title of a prince with God.</p>

<p class='c014'>A shepherd boy, tending his father’s flocks, Joseph’s
pure and simple life had favored the development of
both physical and mental power. By communion with
God through nature and the study of the great truths
handed down as a sacred trust from father to son, he
had gained strength of mind, and firmness of principle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Crisis</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the crisis of his life, when making that terrible
journey from his childhood’s home in Canaan to the
bondage which awaited him in Egypt, looking for the
last time on the hills that hid the tents of his kindred,
Joseph remembered his father’s God. He remembered
the lessons of his childhood, and his soul thrilled with
the resolve to prove himself true,—ever to act as became
a subject of the King of heaven.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Training for Service</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the bitter life of a stranger and a slave, amidst
the sights and sounds of vice and the allurements of
heathen worship, a worship surrounded with all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>attractions of wealth and culture and the pomp of
royalty, Joseph was steadfast. He had learned the
lesson of obedience to duty. Faithfulness in every
station, from the most lowly to the most exalted,
trained every power for highest service.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the time when he was called to the court of
Pharaoh, Egypt was the greatest of nations. In civilization,
art, learning, she was unequaled. Through a
period of utmost difficulty and danger, Joseph administered
the affairs of the kingdom; and this he did in
a manner that won the confidence of the king and
the people. Pharaoh made him “lord of his house,
and ruler of all his substance; to bind his princes at
his pleasure, and teach his senators wisdom.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Secret of Joseph’s Greatness</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The secret of Joseph’s life Inspiration has set before
us. In words of divine power and beauty, Jacob, in the
blessing pronounced upon his children, spoke thus of
his best-loved son:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>And shot at him, and hated him;</div>
      <div class='line'>But his bow abode in strength,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the arms of his hands were made strong</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Daniel</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Perils in Babylon</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Daniel and his companions in Babylon were, in their
youth, apparently more favored of fortune than was
Joseph in the earlier years of his life in Egypt; yet
they were subjected to tests of character scarcely less
severe. From the comparative simplicity of their Judean
home these youth of royal line were transported to the
most magnificent of cities, to the court of its greatest
monarch, and were singled out to be trained for the
king’s special service. Strong were the temptations
surrounding them in that corrupt and luxurious court.
The fact that they, the worshipers of Jehovah, were
captives to Babylon; that the vessels of God’s house had
been placed in the temple of the gods of Babylon; that
the king of Israel was himself a prisoner in the hands of
the Babylonians, was boastfully cited by the victors as
evidence that their religion and customs were superior
to the religion and customs of the Hebrews. Under
such circumstances, through the very humiliations that
Israel’s departure from His commandments had invited,
God gave to Babylon evidence of His supremacy, of the
holiness of His requirements, and of the sure result of
obedience. And this testimony He gave, as alone it
could be given, through those who still held fast their
loyalty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Test of Character</i></div>

<p class='c014'>To Daniel and his companions, at the very outset of
their career, there came a decisive test. The direction
that their food should be supplied from the royal table
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>was an expression both of the king’s favor and of his
solicitude for their welfare. But a portion having been
offered to idols, the food from the king’s table was
consecrated to idolatry; and in partaking of the king’s
bounty these youth would be regarded as uniting in his
homage to false gods. In such homage loyalty to
Jehovah forbade them to participate. Nor dared they
risk the enervating effect of luxury and dissipation on
physical, mental, and spiritual development.</p>

<p class='c014'>Daniel and his companions had been faithfully instructed
in the principles of the word of God. They
had learned to sacrifice the earthly to the spiritual, to
seek the highest good. And they reaped the reward.
Their habits of temperance and their sense of responsibility
as representatives of God called to noblest development
the powers of body, mind, and soul. At
the end of their training, in their examination with
other candidates for the honors of the kingdom, there
was “found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
Azariah.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Foremost among Students</i></div>

<p class='c014'>At the court of Babylon were gathered representatives
from all lands, men of the choicest talents, men the
most richly endowed with natural gifts, and possessed
of the highest culture this world could bestow; yet
amidst them all, the Hebrew captives were without a
peer. In physical strength and beauty, in mental vigor
and literary attainment, they stood unrivaled. “In all
matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king
inquired of them, he found them ten times better than
all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his
realm.”<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Unrivaled Statesman</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Unwavering in allegiance to God, unyielding in the
mastery of himself, Daniel’s noble dignity and courteous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>deference won for him in his youth the “favor and tender
love” of the heathen officer in whose charge he was.
The same characteristics marked his life. Speedily he
rose to the position of prime minister of the kingdom.
Throughout the reign of successive monarchs, the downfall
of the nation, and the establishment of a rival kingdom,
such were his wisdom and statesmanship, so perfect
his tact, his courtesy, and his genuine goodness of heart,
combined with fidelity to principle, that even his enemies
were forced to the confession that “they could find none
occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Heaven’s Ambassador</i></div>

<p class='c014'>While Daniel clung to God with unwavering trust,
the spirit of prophetic power came upon him. While
honored by men with the responsibilities of the court
and the secrets of the kingdom, he was honored by God
as His ambassador, and taught to read the mysteries of
ages to come. Heathen monarchs, through association
with Heaven’s representative, were constrained to acknowledge
the God of Daniel. “Of a truth it is,”
declared Nebuchadnezzar, “that your God is a God of
gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets.”
And Darius, in his proclamation “unto all people, nations,
and languages, that dwell in all the earth,” exalted
the “God of Daniel” as “the living God, and steadfast
forever, and His kingdom that which shall not be
destroyed;” who “delivereth and rescueth, and&nbsp;...
worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>By their wisdom and justice, by the purity and
benevolence of their daily life, by their devotion to the
interests of the people,—and they, idolaters,—Joseph
and Daniel proved themselves true to the principles of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>their early training, true to Him whose representatives
they were. These men, both in Egypt and in Babylon,
the whole nation honored; and in them a heathen people,
and all the nations with which they were connected,
beheld an illustration of the goodness and beneficence of
God, an illustration of the love of Christ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Noble Life-Work</i></div>

<p class='c014'>What a life-work was that of these noble Hebrews!
As they bade farewell to their childhood’s home, how
little did they dream of their high destiny! Faithful and
steadfast, they yielded themselves to the divine guiding,
so that through them God could fulfil His purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'>The same mighty truths that were revealed through
these men, God desires to reveal through the youth
and the children of to-day. The history of Joseph and
Daniel is an illustration of what He will do for those
who yield themselves to Him, and with the whole heart
seek to accomplish His purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The World’s Greatest Need</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The greatest want of the world is the want of men,—men
who will not be bought or sold; men who in their
inmost souls are true and honest; men who do not fear
to call sin by its right name; men whose conscience is
as true to duty as the needle to the pole; men who will
stand for the right though the heavens fall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Self-Discipline</i></div>

<p class='c014'>But such a character is not the result of accident; it
is not due to special favors or endowments of Providence.
A noble character is the result of self-discipline, of the
subjection of the lower to the higher nature,—the surrender
of self for the service of love to God and man.</p>

<p class='c014'>The youth need to be impressed with the truth that
their endowments are not their own. Strength, time,
intellect, are but lent treasures. They belong to God,
and it should be the resolve of every youth to put them
to the highest use. He is a branch, from which God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>expects fruit; a steward, whose capital must yield increase;
a light, to illuminate the world’s darkness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every youth, every child, has a work to do for the
honor of God and the uplifting of humanity.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Elisha</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The early years of the prophet Elisha were passed
in the quietude of country life, under the teaching of
God and nature and the discipline of useful work. In a
time of almost universal apostasy, his father’s household
were among the number who had not bowed the knee
to Baal. Theirs was a home where God was honored,
and where faithfulness to duty was the rule of daily life.</p>

<p class='c014'>The son of a wealthy farmer, Elisha had taken up
the work that lay nearest. While possessing the capabilities
of a leader among men, he received a training in
life’s common duties. In order to direct wisely, he must
learn to obey. By faithfulness in little things, he was
prepared for weightier trusts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Faithfulness in Little Things</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Of a meek and gentle spirit, Elisha possessed also
energy and steadfastness. He cherished the love and
fear of God, and in the humble round of daily toil he
gained strength of purpose and nobleness of character,
growing in divine grace and knowledge. While co-operating
with his father in the home duties, he was
learning to co-operate with God.</p>

<p class='c014'>The prophetic call came to Elisha while with his
father’s servants he was plowing in the field. As Elijah,
divinely directed in seeking a successor, cast his mantle
upon the young man’s shoulders, Elisha recognized and
obeyed the summons. He “went after Elijah, and
ministered unto him.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a> It was no great work that
was at first required of Elisha; commonplace duties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>still constituted his discipline. He is spoken of as pouring
water on the hands of Elijah, his master. As the
prophet’s personal attendant, he continued to prove
faithful in little things, while with daily strengthening
purpose he devoted himself to the mission appointed
him by God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Singleness of Purpose</i></div>

<p class='c014'>When he was first summoned, his resolution had
been tested. As he turned to follow Elijah, he was
bidden by the prophet to return home. He must count
the cost,—decide for himself to accept or reject the
call. But Elisha understood the value of his opportunity.
Not for any worldly advantage would he
forego the possibility of becoming God’s messenger, or
sacrifice the privilege of association with His servant.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Test of Faith</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As time passed, and Elijah was prepared for translation,
so Elisha was prepared to become his successor.
And again his faith and resolution were tested. Accompanying
Elijah in his round of service, knowing the
change soon to come, he was at each place invited by
the prophet to turn back. “Tarry here, I pray thee,”
Elijah said; “for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel.”
But in his early labor of guiding the plow, Elisha had
learned not to fail or to become discouraged; and now
that he had set his hand to the plow in another line of
duty, he would not be diverted from his purpose. As
often as the invitation to turn back was given, his answer
was, “As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will
not leave thee.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Supreme Gift</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“And they two went on.... And they two
stood by Jordan. And Elijah took his mantle, and
wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they
were divided hither and thither, so that they two went
over on dry ground. And it came to pass, when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what
I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.
And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy
spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a
hard thing; nevertheless, if thou see me when I am
taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it
shall not be so. And it came to pass, as they still
went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a
chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them
both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
heaven.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my
father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof!
And he saw him no more; and he took hold of his own
clothes, and rent them in two pieces. He took up also
the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back,
and stood by the bank of Jordan; and he took the
mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the
waters, and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah?
And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted
hither and thither; and Elisha went over. And when
the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho
saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on
Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves
to the ground before him.”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Henceforth Elisha stood in Elijah’s place. And he
who had been faithful in that which was least, proved
himself faithful also in much.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Fruits of Practical Training</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Elijah, the man of power, had been God’s instrument
for the overthrow of gigantic evils. Idolatry,
which, supported by Ahab and the heathen Jezebel,
had seduced the nation, had been cast down. Baal’s
prophets had been slain. The whole people of Israel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>had been deeply stirred, and many were returning to
the worship of God. As successor to Elijah was
needed one who by careful, patient instruction could
guide Israel in safe paths. For this work Elisha’s early
training under God’s direction had prepared him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Lesson for All</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The lesson is for all. None can know what may be
God’s purpose in His discipline; but all may be certain
that faithfulness in little things is the evidence of fitness
for greater responsibilities. Every act of life is a revelation
of character, and he only who in small duties proves
himself “a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
will be honored by God with weightier trusts.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Moses</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Younger than Joseph or Daniel was Moses when
removed from the sheltering care of his childhood’s
home; yet already the same agencies that shaped their
lives had moulded his. Only twelve years did he spend
with his Hebrew kindred; but during these years was
laid the foundation of his greatness; it was laid by the
hand of one little known to fame.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Mother’s Teaching</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Jochebed was a woman and a slave. Her lot in life
was humble, her burden heavy. But through no other
woman, save Mary of Nazareth, has the world received
greater blessing. Knowing that her child must soon
pass beyond her care, to the guardianship of those who
knew not God, she the more earnestly endeavored to
link his soul with heaven. She sought to implant in
his heart love and loyalty to God. And faithfully was
the work accomplished. Those principles of truth that
were the burden of his mother’s teaching and the lesson
of her life, no after-influence could induce Moses to
renounce.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>In the Schools of Egypt</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>From the humble home in Goshen, the son of
Jochebed passed to the palace of the Pharaohs, to the
Egyptian princess, by her to be welcomed as a loved
and cherished son. In the schools of Egypt, Moses
received the highest civil and military training. Of
great personal attractions, noble in form and stature, of
cultivated mind and princely bearing, and renowned as
a military leader, he became the nation’s pride. The
king of Egypt was also a member of the priesthood:
and Moses, though refusing to participate in the heathen
worship, was initiated into all the mysteries of the
Egyptian religion. Egypt at this time being still the
most powerful and most highly civilized of nations,
Moses, as its prospective sovereign, was heir to the
highest honors this world could bestow. But his was
a nobler choice. For the honor of God and the deliverance
of His downtrodden people, Moses sacrificed the
honors of Egypt. Then, in a special sense, God undertook
his training.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Lesson of Defeat</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Not yet was Moses prepared for his life-work. He
had yet to learn the lesson of dependence upon divine
power. He had mistaken God’s purpose. It was his
hope to deliver Israel by force of arms. For this he
risked all, and failed. In defeat and disappointment he
became a fugitive and exile in a strange land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Training for Leadership</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the wilds of Midian, Moses spent forty years as
a keeper of sheep. Apparently cut off forever from his
life’s mission, he was receiving the discipline essential
for its fulfilment. Wisdom to govern an ignorant and
undisciplined multitude must be gained through self-mastery.
In the care of the sheep and the tender
lambs he must obtain the experience that would make
him a faithful, long-suffering shepherd to Israel. That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>he might become a representative of God, he must learn
of Him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The influences that had surrounded him in Egypt,
the affection of his foster-mother, his own position as
the grandson of the king, the luxury and vice that
allured in ten thousand forms, the refinement, the subtlety,
and the mysticism of a false religion, had made
an impression on his mind and character. In the stern
simplicity of the wilderness, all this disappeared.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Alone with God</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Amidst the solemn majesty of the mountain solitudes,
Moses was alone with God. Everywhere the
Creator’s name was written. Moses seemed to stand
in His presence, and to be overshadowed by His power.
Here his self-sufficiency was swept away. In the presence
of the Infinite One he realized how weak, how
inefficient, how short-sighted, is man.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here Moses gained that which went with him
throughout the years of his toilsome and care-burdened
life,—a sense of the personal presence of the Divine
One. Not merely did he look down the ages for Christ
to be made manifest in the flesh; he saw Christ accompanying
the host of Israel in all their travels. When
misunderstood and misrepresented, when called to bear
reproach and insult, to face danger and death, he was
able to endure “as seeing Him who is invisible.”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Moses did not merely think of God; he saw Him.
God was the constant vision before him. Never did he
lose sight of His face.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Power through Faith</i></div>

<p class='c014'>To Moses faith was no guesswork; it was a reality.
He believed that God ruled his life in particular; and
in all its details he acknowledged Him. For strength
to withstand every temptation, he trusted in Him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The great work assigned him he desired to make in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the highest degree successful, and he placed his whole
dependence upon divine power. He felt his need of
help, asked for it, by faith grasped it, and in the assurance
of sustaining strength went forward.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Results of His Training</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Such was the experience that Moses gained by his
forty years of training in the desert. To impart such
an experience, Infinite Wisdom counted not the period
too long or the price too great.</p>

<p class='c014'>The results of that training, of the lessons there
taught, are bound up, not only with the history of
Israel, but with all which from that day to this has told
for the world’s progress. The highest testimony to the
greatness of Moses, the judgment passed upon his life
by Inspiration, is, “There arose not a prophet since in
Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to
face.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Paul</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>An Hebrew of the Hebrews</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>With the faith and experience of the Galilean disciples
who had companied with Jesus were united, in
the work of the gospel, the fiery vigor and intellectual
power of a rabbi of Jerusalem. A Roman citizen, born
in a Gentile city; a Jew, not only by descent but by
lifelong training, patriotic devotion, and religious faith;
educated in Jerusalem by the most eminent of the
rabbis, and instructed in all the laws and traditions of
the fathers, Saul of Tarsus shared to the fullest extent
the pride and the prejudices of his nation. While still
a young man, he became an honored member of the
Sanhedrin. He was looked upon as a man of promise,
a zealous defender of the ancient faith.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the theological schools of Judea, the word
of God had been set aside for human speculations;
it was robbed of its power by the interpretations and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>traditions of the rabbis. Self-aggrandizement, love of
domination, jealous exclusiveness, bigotry and contemptuous
pride, were the ruling principles and motives of
these teachers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Leader in Persecution</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The rabbis gloried in their superiority, not only to
the people of other nations, but to the masses of their
own. With their fierce hatred of their Roman oppressors,
they cherished the determination to recover by force
of arms their national supremacy. The followers of
Jesus, whose message of peace was so contrary to
their schemes of ambition, they hated and put to death.
In this persecution, Saul was one of the most bitter and
relentless actors.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the military schools of Egypt, Moses was taught
the law of force, and so strong a hold did this teaching
have upon his character that it required forty years of
quiet and communion with God and nature to fit him
for the leadership of Israel by the law of love. The
same lesson Paul had to learn.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Vision of the Crucified</i></div>

<p class='c014'>At the gate of Damascus the vision of the Crucified
One changed the whole current of his life. The persecutor
became a disciple, the teacher a learner. The
days of darkness spent in solitude at Damascus were
as years in his experience. The Old Testament Scriptures
stored in his memory were his study, and Christ
his teacher. To him also nature’s solitudes became a
school. To the desert of Arabia he went, there to
study the Scriptures and to learn of God. He emptied
his soul of the prejudices and traditions that had shaped
his life, and received instruction from the Source of
truth.</p>

<p class='c014'>His after-life was inspired by the one principle of
self-sacrifice, the ministry of love. “I am debtor,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>said, “both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians; both
to the wise, and to the unwise.” “The love of Christ
constraineth us.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Craftsman</i>, <i>Preacher</i>, <i>Missionary</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The greatest of human teachers, Paul accepted the
lowliest as well as the highest duties. He recognized
the necessity of labor for the hand as well as for the
mind, and he wrought at a handicraft for his own support.
His trade of tent-making he pursued while daily
preaching the gospel in the great centers of civilization.
“These hands,” he said, at parting with the elders of
Ephesus, “have ministered unto my necessities, and to
them that were with me.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sympathy and Insight</i></div>

<p class='c014'>While he possessed high intellectual endowments,
the life of Paul revealed the power of a rarer wisdom.
Principles of deepest import, principles concerning which
the greatest minds of his time were ignorant, are unfolded
in his teachings and exemplified in his life. He
had that greatest of all wisdom, which gives quickness
of insight and sympathy of heart, which brings man in
touch with men, and enables him to arouse their better
nature and inspire them to a higher life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Listen to his words before the heathen Lystrians, as
he points them to God revealed in nature, the Source of
all good, who “gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful
seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mastership</i></div>

<p class='c014'>See him in the dungeon at Philippi, where, despite
his pain-racked body, his song of praise breaks the
silence of midnight. After the earthquake has opened
the prison doors, his voice is again heard, in words of
cheer to the heathen jailer, “Do thyself no harm; for
we are all here,”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a>—every man in his place, restrained by
the presence of one fellow-prisoner. And the jailer,
convicted of the reality of that faith which sustains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Paul, inquires the way of salvation, and with his whole
household unites with the persecuted band of Christ’s
disciples.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>In Advance of His Age</i></div>

<p class='c014'>See Paul at Athens before the council of the Areopagus,
as he meets science with science, logic with logic,
and philosophy with philosophy. Mark how, with
the tact born of divine love, he points to Jehovah as
the “Unknown God,” whom his hearers have ignorantly
worshiped; and in words quoted from a poet of
their own he pictures Him as a Father whose children
they are. Hear him, in that age of caste, when the
rights of man as man were wholly unrecognized, as
he sets forth the great truth of human brotherhood,
declaring that God “hath made of one blood all nations
of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth.” Then
he shows how, through all the dealings of God with
man, runs like a thread of gold His purpose of grace
and mercy. He “hath determined the times before
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they
should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after
Him, and find Him, though He be not far from every
one of us.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Hear him in the court of Festus, when King
Agrippa, convicted of the truth of the gospel, exclaims,
“Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.” With
what gentle courtesy does Paul, pointing to his own
chain, make answer, “I would to God, that not only
thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both
almost and altogether such as I am, except these
bonds.”<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c015'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Strenuous Life</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Thus passed his life, as described in his own words,
“in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of
robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness,
in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;
in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in
hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Joy of Service</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“Being reviled,” he said, “we bless; being persecuted,
we suffer it; being defamed, we entreat;” “as
sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making
many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all
things.”<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In service he found his joy; and at the close of his
life of toil, looking back on its struggles and triumphs,
he could say, “I have fought a good fight.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Satisfied with Their Choice</i></div>

<p class='c014'>These histories are of vital interest. To none are
they of deeper importance than to the youth. Moses
renounced a prospective kingdom, Paul the advantages
of wealth and honor among his people, for a life of
burden-bearing in God’s service. To many the life of
these men appears one of renunciation and sacrifice.
Was it really so? Moses counted the reproach of
Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt. He
counted it so because it was so. Paul declared: “What
things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for
Christ. Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my
Lord; for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and
do count them but refuse that I may gain Christ.”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a> He
was satisfied with his choice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Abiding Greatness</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Moses was offered the palace of the Pharaohs and
the monarch’s throne; but the sinful pleasures that
make men forget God were in those lordly courts, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>he chose instead the “durable riches and righteousness.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c015'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
Instead of linking himself with the greatness
of Egypt, he chose to bind up his life with God’s purpose.
Instead of giving laws to Egypt, he by divine
direction enacted laws for the world. He became
God’s instrument in giving to men those principles that
are the safeguard alike of the home and of society, that
are the corner-stone of the prosperity of nations,—principles
recognized to-day by the world’s greatest men
as the foundation of all that is best in human governments.</p>

<p class='c014'>The greatness of Egypt is in the dust. Its power
and civilization have passed away. But the work of
Moses can never perish. The great principles of righteousness
which he lived to establish are eternal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>With Christ</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Moses’ life of toil and heart-burdening care was irradiated
with the presence of Him who is “the chiefest
among ten thousand,” and the One “altogether lovely.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a>
With Christ in the wilderness wandering, with Christ on
the mount of transfiguration, with Christ in the heavenly
courts,—his was a life on earth blessing and blessed,
and in heaven honored.</p>

<p class='c014'>Paul also in his manifold labors was upheld by
the sustaining power of His presence. “I can do all
things,” he said, “through Christ which strengtheneth
me.” “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
or nakedness, or peril, or sword?... Nay, in all
these things we are more than conquerors through Him
that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor
depth, nor any other created thing,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c015'><sup>[81]</sup></a> shall be able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Life’s Recompense</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Yet there is a future joy to which Paul looked forward
as the recompense of his labors,—the same joy for
the sake of which Christ endured the cross and despised
the shame,—the joy of seeing the fruition of his work.
“What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?” he
wrote to the Thessalonian converts. “Are not even ye
in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?
For ye are our glory and joy.”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Who can measure the results to the world of Paul’s
life-work? Of all those beneficent influences that alleviate
suffering, that comfort sorrow, that restrain evil,
that uplift life from the selfish and the sensual, and
glorify it with the hope of immortality, how much is
due to the labors of Paul and his fellow-workers, as with
the gospel of the Son of God they made their unnoticed
journey from Asia to the shores of Europe?</p>

<p class='c014'>What is it worth to any life to have been God’s
instrument in setting in motion such influences of blessing?
What will it be worth in eternity to witness the
results of such a life-work?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Heaven’s Best and Greatest</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the Teacher sent from God, heaven gave to men
its best and greatest. He who had stood in the councils
of the Most High, who had dwelt in the innermost
sanctuary of the Eternal, was the One chosen to reveal
in person to humanity the knowledge of God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Perfect Ideal</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Through Christ had been communicated every ray
of divine light that had ever reached our fallen world.
It was He who had spoken through every one that
throughout the ages had declared God’s word to man.
Of Him all the excellences manifest in the earth’s
greatest and noblest souls were reflections. The purity
and beneficence of Joseph, the faith and meekness and
long-suffering of Moses, the steadfastness of Elisha, the
noble integrity and firmness of Daniel, the ardor and
self-sacrifice of Paul, the mental and spiritual power manifest
in all these men, and in all others who had ever
dwelt on the earth, were but gleams from the shining
of His glory. In Him was found the perfect ideal.</p>

<p class='c014'>To reveal this ideal as the only true standard for
attainment; to show what every human being might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>become; what, through the indwelling of humanity by
divinity, all who received Him would become,—for this,
Christ came to the world. He came to show how men
are to be trained as befits the sons of God; how on
earth they are to practise the principles and to live the
life of heaven.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Results of False Teaching</i></div>

<p class='c014'>God’s greatest gift was bestowed to meet man’s
greatest need. The Light appeared when the world’s
darkness was deepest. Through false teaching, the
minds of men had long been turned away from God.
In the prevailing systems of education, human philosophy
had taken the place of divine revelation. Instead
of the heaven-given standard of truth, men had accepted
a standard of their own devising. From the
Light of life they had turned aside to walk in the sparks
of the fire which they had kindled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pretense for Reality</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Having separated from God, their only dependence
being the power of humanity, their strength was but
weakness. Even the standard set up by themselves
they were incapable of reaching. The want of true
excellence was supplied by appearance and profession.
Semblance took the place of reality.</p>

<p class='c014'>From time to time, teachers arose who pointed men
to the Source of truth. Right principles were enunciated,
and human lives witnessed to their power. But
these efforts made no lasting impression. There was
a brief check in the current of evil, but its downward
course was not stayed. The reformers were as lights
that shone in the darkness; but they could not dispel
it. The world “loved darkness rather than light.”<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Formalism; Materialism</i></div>

<p class='c014'>When Christ came to the earth, humanity seemed
to be fast reaching its lowest point. The very foundations
of society were undermined. Life had become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>false and artificial. The Jews, destitute of the power
of God’s word, gave to the world mind-benumbing,
soul-deadening traditions and speculations. The worship
of God “in Spirit and in truth,” had been supplanted
by the glorification of men in an endless round
of man-made ceremonies. Throughout the world, all
systems of religion were losing their hold on mind and
soul. Disgusted with fable and falsehood, seeking to
drown thought, men turned to infidelity and materialism.
Leaving eternity out of their reckoning, they
lived for the present.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Human Rights Disregarded</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As they ceased to recognize the Divine, they ceased
to regard the human. Truth, honor, integrity, confidence,
compassion, were departing from the earth.
Relentless greed and absorbing ambition gave birth to
universal distrust. The idea of duty, of the obligation
of strength to weakness, of human dignity and human
rights, was cast aside as a dream or a fable. The common
people were regarded as beasts of burden or as
the tools and the stepping-stones for ambition. Wealth
and power, ease and self-indulgence, were sought as
the highest good. Physical degeneracy, mental stupor,
spiritual death, characterized the age.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Misconception of God</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Evil Unrestrained</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As the evil passions and purposes of men banished
God from their thoughts, so forgetfulness of Him inclined
them more strongly to evil. The heart in love
with sin clothed Him with its own attributes, and this
conception strengthened the power of sin. Bent on
self-pleasing, men came to regard God as such a one as
themselves,—a Being whose aim was self-glory, whose
requirements were suited to His own pleasure; a Being
by whom men were lifted up or cast down according
as they helped or hindered His selfish purpose. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>lower classes regarded the Supreme Being as one
scarcely differing from their oppressors, save by exceeding
them in power. By these ideas every form of
religion was moulded. Each was a system of exaction.
By gifts and ceremonies, the worshipers sought to propitiate
the Deity, in order to secure His favor for their
own ends. Such religion, having no power upon the
heart or the conscience, could be but a round of forms,
of which men wearied, and from which, except for such
gain as it might offer, they longed to be free. So evil,
unrestrained, grew stronger, while the appreciation and
desire for good diminished. Men lost the image of
God, and received the impress of the demoniacal power
by which they were controlled. The whole world was
becoming a sink of corruption.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Power of a New Life</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There was but one hope for the human race,—that
into this mass of discordant and corrupting elements
might be cast a new leaven; that there might be brought
to mankind the power of a new life; that the knowledge
of God might be restored to the world.</p>

<p class='c014'>Christ came to restore this knowledge. He came to
set aside the false teaching by which those who claimed
to know God had misrepresented Him. He came to
manifest the nature of His law, to reveal in His own
character the beauty of holiness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>With the Love of Eternity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Christ came to the world with the accumulated love
of eternity. Sweeping away the exactions which had
encumbered the law of God, He showed that the law is
a law of love, an expression of the Divine Goodness.
He showed that in obedience to its principles is involved
the happiness of mankind, and with it the stability, the
very foundation and framework, of human society.</p>

<p class='c014'>So far from making arbitrary requirements, God’s law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>is given to men as a hedge, a shield. Whoever accepts
its principles is preserved from evil. Fidelity to God
involves fidelity to man. Thus the law guards the
rights, the individuality, of every human being. It
restrains the superior from oppression, and the subordinate
from disobedience. It insures man’s well-being,
both for this world and for the world to come. To the
obedient it is the pledge of eternal life; for it expresses
the principles that endure forever.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Demonstration of True Principles</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Christ came to demonstrate the value of the divine
principles by revealing their power for the regeneration
of humanity. He came to teach how these principles
are to be developed and applied.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Simplicity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>With the people of that age, the value of all things
was determined by outward show. As religion had
declined in power, it had increased in pomp. The educators
of the time sought to command respect by display
and ostentation. To all this the life of Jesus presented
a marked contrast. His life demonstrated the worthlessness
of those things that men regarded as life’s great
essentials. Born amidst surroundings the rudest, sharing
a peasant’s home, a peasant’s fare, a craftsman’s
occupation, living a life of obscurity, identifying Himself
with the world’s unknown toilers,—amidst these conditions
and surroundings,—Jesus followed the divine plan
of education. The schools of His time, with their magnifying
of things small and their belittling of things
great, He did not seek. His education was gained
directly from the Heaven-appointed sources; from useful
work, from the study of the Scriptures and of nature,
and from the experiences of life,—God’s lesson-books,
full of instruction to all who bring to them the willing
hand, the seeing eye, and the understanding heart.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“The Child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled
with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.”<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Thus prepared, He went forth to His mission, in
every moment of His contact with men exerting upon
them an influence to bless, a power to transform, such
as the world had never witnessed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sympathy</i></div>

<p class='c014'>He who seeks to transform humanity must himself
understand humanity. Only through sympathy, faith,
and love can men be reached and uplifted. Here Christ
stands revealed as the master teacher; of all that ever
dwelt on the earth, He alone has perfect understanding
of the human soul.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We have not a high priest”—master teacher, for
the priests were teachers—“we have not a high priest
that can not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;
but one that hath been in all points tempted like as
we are.”<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c015'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>He Suffered Being Tempted</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>“In that He Himself hath suffered being tempted,
He is able to succor them that are tempted.”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c015'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Christ alone had experience in all the sorrows and
temptations that befall human beings. Never another of
woman born was so fiercely beset by temptation; never
another bore so heavy a burden of the world’s sin and
pain. Never was there another whose sympathies were
so broad or so tender. A sharer in all the experiences
of humanity, He could feel not only for, but with, every
burdened and tempted and struggling one.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>What He Taught, He Was</i></div>

<p class='c014'>What He taught, He lived. “I have given you an
example,” He said to His disciples; “that ye should do
as I have done.” “I have kept My Father’s commandments.”<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c015'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
Thus in His life, Christ’s words had perfect
illustration and support. And more than this; what He
taught, He was. His words were the expression, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>only of His own life-experience, but of His own character.
Not only did He teach the truth, but He was
the truth. It was this that gave His teaching power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Power to Win Hearts</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Christ was a faithful reprover. Never lived there
another who so hated evil; never another whose denunciation
of it was so fearless. To all things untrue and
base His very presence was a rebuke. In the light of
His purity, men saw themselves unclean, their life’s aims
mean and false. Yet He drew them. He who had
created man, understood the value of humanity. Evil
He denounced as the foe of those whom He was seeking
to bless and to save. In every human being, however
fallen, He beheld a son of God, one who might be
restored to the privilege of his divine relationship.</p>

<p class='c014'>“God sent not His Son into the world to condemn
the world; but that the world through Him might be
saved.”<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c015'><sup>[90]</sup></a> Looking upon men in their suffering and
degradation, Christ perceived ground for hope where
appeared only despair and ruin. Wherever there existed
a sense of need, there He saw opportunity for uplifting.
Souls tempted, defeated, feeling themselves lost, ready to
perish, He met, not with denunciation, but with blessing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Salutation of Blessing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The beatitudes were His greeting to the whole
human family. Looking upon the vast throng gathered
to listen to the sermon on the mount, He seemed for the
moment to have forgotten that He was not in heaven,
and He used the familiar salutation of the world of light.
From His lips flowed blessings as the gushing forth of a
long-sealed fountain.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turning from the ambitious, self-satisfied favorites
of this world, He declared that those were blessed
who, however great their need, would receive His light
and love. To the poor in spirit, the sorrowing, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>persecuted, He stretched out His arms, saying, “Come
unto Me.... I will give you rest.”<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c015'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Perception of Man’s Possibilities</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In every human being He discerned infinite possibilities.
He saw men as they might be, transfigured by
His grace,—in “the beauty of the Lord our God.”<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c015'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
Looking upon them with hope, He inspired hope.
Meeting them with confidence, He inspired trust. Revealing
in Himself man’s true ideal, He awakened, for
its attainment, both desire and faith. In His presence
souls despised and fallen realized that they still were
men, and they longed to prove themselves worthy of
His regard. In many a heart that seemed dead to all
things holy were awakened new impulses. To many a
despairing one there opened the possibility of a new life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Christ bound men to His heart by the ties of love
and devotion; and by the same ties He bound them to
their fellow-men. With Him love was life, and life was
service. “Freely ye have received,” He said, “freely

<div class='sidenote'><i>In the Secret Place of Power</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It was not on the cross only that Christ sacrificed
Himself for humanity. As “He went about doing
good,”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a> every-day’s experience was an outpouring of
His life. In one way only could such a life be sustained.
Jesus lived in dependence upon God and communion
with Him. To the secret place of the Most High, under
the shadow of the Almighty, men now and then repair;
they abide for a season, and the result is manifest in
noble deeds; then their faith fails, the communion is
interrupted, and the life-work marred. But the life of
Jesus was a life of constant trust, sustained by continual
communion; and His service for heaven and
earth was without failure or faltering.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a man He supplicated the throne of God, till His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>humanity was charged with a heavenly current that connected
humanity with divinity. Receiving life from God,
He imparted life to men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Scope of His Teaching</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“Never man spake like this Man.”<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a> This would
have been true of Christ had He taught only in the
realm of the physical and the intellectual, or in matters
of theory and speculation solely. He might have
unlocked mysteries that have required centuries of toil
and study to penetrate. He might have made suggestions
in scientific lines that, till the close of time, would
have afforded food for thought and stimulus for invention.
But He did not do this. He said nothing to
gratify curiosity or to stimulate selfish ambition. He
did not deal in abstract theories, but in that which is
essential to the development of character; that which
will enlarge man’s capacity for knowing God, and
increase his power to do good. He spoke of those
truths that relate to the conduct of life, and that unite
man with eternity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Instead of directing the people to study men’s theories
about God, His word, or His works, He taught
them to behold Him, as manifested in His works, in
His word, and by His providences. He brought their
minds in contact with the mind of the Infinite.</p>

<p class='c014'>The people “were astonished at His teaching;<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c015'><sup>[96]</sup></a> for
His word was with power.”<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a> Never before spoke one
who had such power to awaken thought, to kindle aspiration,
to arouse every capability of body, mind, and soul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>For All Men and All Ages</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Christ’s teaching, like His sympathies, embraced the
world. Never can there be a circumstance of life, a
crisis in human experience, which has not been anticipated
in His teaching, and for which its principles have
not a lesson. The Prince of teachers, His words will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>be found a guide to His co-workers till the end of time.</p>

<p class='c014'>To Him the present and the future, the near and the
far, were one. He had in view the needs of all mankind.
Before His mind’s eye was outspread every scene
of human effort and achievement, of temptation and conflict,
of perplexity and peril. All hearts, all homes, all
pleasures and joys and aspirations, were known to Him.</p>

<p class='c014'>He spoke not only for, but to, all mankind. To the
little child, in the gladness of life’s morning; to the
eager, restless heart of youth; to men in the strength of
their years, bearing the burden of responsibility and
care; to the aged in their weakness and weariness,—to
all, His message was spoken,—to every child of
humanity, in every land and in every age.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Life’s True Valuation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In His teaching were embraced the things of time
and the things of eternity,—things seen, in their relation
to things unseen, the passing incidents of common life
and the solemn issues of the life to come.</p>

<p class='c014'>The things of this life He placed in their true relation,
as subordinate to those of eternal interest; but He
did not ignore their importance. He taught that heaven
and earth are linked together, and that a knowledge of
divine truth prepares man better to perform the duties
of daily life.</p>

<p class='c014'>To Him nothing was without purpose. The sports
of the child, the toils of the man, life’s pleasures and
cares and pains, all were means to the one end,—the
revelation of God for the uplifting of humanity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>God with Us</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>From His lips the word of God came home to
men’s hearts with new power and new meaning. His
teaching caused the things of creation to stand out in
new light. Upon the face of nature once more rested
gleamings of that brightness which sin had banished.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>In all the facts and experiences of life were revealed
a divine lesson and the possibility of divine companionship.
Again God dwelt on earth; human hearts
became conscious of His presence; the world was
encompassed with His love. Heaven came down to
men. In Christ their hearts acknowledged Him who
had opened to them the science of eternity,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Immanuel, God with us.”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>In the Teacher sent from God, all true educational
work finds its center. Of this work to-day as verily as
of the work He established eighteen hundred years ago,
the Saviour speaks in the words,—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>The First and the Last</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>“I am the first and the last, and the Living One.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and
the end.”<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c015'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In the presence of such a Teacher, of such opportunity
for divine education, what worse than folly is
it to seek an education apart from Him,—to seek to
be wise apart from Wisdom; to be true while rejecting
Truth; to seek illumination apart from the Light, and
existence without the Life; to turn from the Fountain
of living waters, and hew out broken cisterns, that can
hold no water.</p>

<p class='c014'>Behold, He is still inviting: “If any man thirst, let
him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on
Me, as the Scripture hath said,” out of him “shall flow
rivers of living water.” “The water that I shall give
him shall become in him a well of water springing up
unto eternal life.”<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c015'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Training of the Twelve</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The most complete illustration of Christ’s methods
as a teacher is found in His training of the twelve
first disciples. Upon these men were to rest weighty
responsibilities. He had chosen them as men whom
He could imbue with His Spirit, and who could be
fitted to carry forward His work on earth when He
should leave it. To them, above all others, He gave
the advantage of His own companionship. Through
personal association He impressed Himself upon these
chosen co-laborers. “The Life was manifested,” says
John the beloved, “and we have seen it, and bear
witness.”<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c015'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Only by such communion,—the communion of mind
with mind and heart with heart, of the human with the
divine,—can be communicated that vitalizing energy
which it is the work of true education to impart. It
is only life that begets life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Family School</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the training of His disciples the Saviour followed
the system of education established at the beginning.
The twelve first chosen, with a few others who through
ministry to their needs were from time to time connected
with them, formed the family of Jesus. They were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>with Him in the house, at the table, in the closet, in
the field. They accompanied Him on His journeys,
shared His trials and hardships, and, as much as in
them was, entered into His work.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes He taught them as they sat together on
the mountainside, sometimes beside the sea, or from the
fisherman’s boat, sometimes as they walked by the way.
Whenever He spoke to the multitude, the disciples
formed the inner circle. They pressed close beside
Him, that they might lose nothing of His instruction.
They were attentive listeners, eager to understand the
truths they were to teach in all lands and to all ages.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>From the Common People</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The first pupils of Jesus were chosen from the ranks
of the common people. They were humble, unlettered
men, these fishers of Galilee; men unschooled in the
learning and customs of the rabbis, but trained by the
stern discipline of toil and hardship. They were men of
native ability and of teachable spirit; men who could be
instructed and moulded for the Saviour’s work. In the
common walks of life there is many a toiler patiently
treading the round of his daily tasks, unconscious of
latent powers that, roused to action, would place him
among the world’s great leaders. Such were the men
who were called by the Saviour to be His co-laborers.
And they had the advantage of three years’ training by
the greatest educator this world has ever known.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Types of Character</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In these first disciples was presented a marked
diversity. They were to be the world’s teachers, and
they represented widely varied types of character.
There were Levi Matthew the publican, called from a
life of business activity, and subservience to Rome; the
zealot Simon, the uncompromising foe of the imperial
authority; the impulsive, self-sufficient, warm-hearted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Peter, with Andrew his brother; Judas the Judean,
polished, capable, and mean-spirited; Philip and Thomas,
faithful and earnest, yet slow of heart to believe; James
the less and Jude, of less prominence among the brethren,
but men of force, positive both in their faults and in
their virtues; Nathanael, a child in sincerity and trust;
and the ambitious, loving-hearted sons of Zebedee.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>To Come into Unity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In order successfully to carry forward the work to
which they had been called, these disciples, differing
so widely in natural characteristics, in training, and in
habits of life, needed to come into unity of feeling,
thought, and action. This unity it was Christ’s object
to secure. To this end He sought to bring them into
unity with Himself. The burden of His labor for them
is expressed in His prayer to the Father, “that they all
may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee,
that they also may be one in Us;&nbsp;... that the
world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast
loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Closest Companions</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Of the twelve disciples, four were to act a leading
part, each in a distinct line. In preparation for this,
Christ taught them, foreseeing all. James, destined to
swift-coming death by the sword; John, longest of the
brethren to follow his Master in labor and persecution;
Peter, the pioneer in breaking through the barriers of
ages, and teaching the heathen world; and Judas, in
service capable of pre-eminence above his brethren, yet
brooding in his soul purposes of whose ripening he
little dreamed,—these were the objects of Christ’s greatest
solicitude, and the recipients of His most frequent
and careful instruction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>John</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Peter, James, and John sought every opportunity of
coming into close contact with their Master, and their
desire was granted. Of all the twelve their relationship
to Him was closest. John could be satisfied only
with a still nearer intimacy, and this he obtained. At
that first conference beside the Jordan, when Andrew,
having heard Jesus, hurried away to call his brother,
John sat silent, rapt in the contemplation of wondrous
themes. He followed the Saviour, ever an eager,
absorbed listener. Yet John’s was no faultless character.
He was no gentle, dreamy enthusiast. He and
his brother were called “the sons of thunder.”<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a> John
was proud, ambitious, combative; but beneath all this
the divine Teacher discerned the ardent, sincere, loving
heart. Jesus rebuked his self-seeking, disappointed his
ambitions, tested his faith. But He revealed to him that
for which his soul longed,—the beauty of holiness, His
own transforming love. “Unto the men which Thou
gavest Me out of the world,” He said to the Father,
“I have manifested Thy name.”<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c015'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Fellowship</i>; <i>Transformation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>John’s was a nature that longed for love, for sympathy
and companionship. He pressed close to Jesus,
sat by His side, leaned upon His breast. As a flower
the sun and dew, so did he drink in the divine light and
life. In adoration and love he beheld the Saviour, until
likeness to Christ and fellowship with Him became his
one desire, and in his character was reflected the character
of his Master.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Behold,” he said, “what manner of love the Father
hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the
sons of God; therefore the world knoweth us not,
because it knew Him not. Beloved, now are we the
sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>be; but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall
be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every
man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even
as He is pure.”<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c015'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peter</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The history of no one of the disciples better illustrates
Christ’s method of training than does the history
of Peter. Bold, aggressive, and self-confident, quick
to perceive and forward to act, prompt in retaliation
yet generous in forgiving, Peter often erred, and often
received reproof. Nor were his warm-hearted loyalty
and devotion to Christ the less decidedly recognized
and commended. Patiently, with discriminating love,
the Saviour dealt with His impetuous disciple, seeking
to check his self-confidence, and to teach him humility,
obedience, and trust.</p>

<p class='c014'>But only in part was the lesson learned. Self-assurance
was not uprooted.</p>

<p class='c014'>Often Jesus, the burden heavy upon His own heart,
sought to open to the disciples the scenes of His trial
and suffering. But their eyes were holden. The knowledge
was unwelcome, and they did not see. Self-pity,
that shrank from fellowship with Christ in suffering,
prompted Peter’s remonstrance, “Pity Thyself, Lord;
this shall not be unto Thee.”<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c015'><sup>[105]</sup></a> His words expressed
the thought and feeling of the twelve.</p>

<p class='c014'>So they went on, the crisis drawing nearer; they,
boastful, contentious, in anticipation apportioning regal
honors, and dreaming not of the cross.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rebuke That Reclaims</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>I Have Prayed for Thee</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>For them all, Peter’s experience had a lesson. To
self-trust, trial is defeat. The sure outworking of evil
still unforsaken, Christ could not prevent. But as His
hand had been outstretched to save when the waves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>were about to sweep over Peter, so did His love reach
out for his rescue when the deep waters swept over his
soul. Over and over again, on the very verge of ruin,
Peter’s words of boasting brought him nearer and still
nearer to the brink. Over and over again was given
the warning, “Thou shalt&nbsp;... deny that thou
knowest Me.”<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c015'><sup>[106]</sup></a> It was the grieved, loving heart of
the disciple that spoke out in the avowal, “Lord, I am
ready to go with Thee, both into prison, and to death;”<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c015'><sup>[107]</sup></a>
and He who reads the heart gave to Peter the message,
little valued then, but that in the swift-falling darkness
would shed a ray of hope: “Simon, Simon, behold,
Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you
as wheat. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith
fail not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren.”<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c015'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>When Thou Art Converted</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>When in the judgment-hall the words of denial had
been spoken; when Peter’s love and loyalty, awakened
under the Saviour’s glance of pity and love and sorrow,
had sent him forth to the garden where Christ had wept
and prayed; when his tears of remorse dropped upon
the sod that had been moistened with the blood-drops
of His agony,—then the Saviour’s words, “I have prayed
for thee;&nbsp;... when thou art converted, strengthen
thy brethren,” were a stay to his soul. Christ, though
foreseeing his sin, had not abandoned him to despair.</p>

<p class='c014'>If the look that Jesus cast upon him had spoken
condemnation instead of pity; if in foretelling the sin He
had failed of speaking hope, how dense would have been
the darkness that encompassed Peter! how reckless the
despair of that tortured soul! In that hour of anguish
and self-abhorrence, what could have held him back from
the path trodden by Judas?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Not Alone</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>He who could not spare His disciple the anguish, left
him not alone to its bitterness. His is a love that fails
not nor forsakes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Human beings, themselves given to evil, are prone to
deal untenderly with the tempted and the erring. They
can not read the heart, they know not its struggle and
pain. Of the rebuke that is love, of the blow that
wounds to heal, of the warning that speaks hope, they
have need to learn.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Tell Peter</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>It was not John, the one who watched with Him
in the judgment-hall, who stood beside His cross, and
who of the twelve was first at the tomb,—it was not
John, but Peter, that was mentioned by name in the first
message sent to the disciples by Christ after His resurrection.
“Tell His disciples and Peter,” the angel said,
“that He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye
see Him.”<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c015'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>At the last meeting of Christ with the disciples
by the sea, Peter, tested by the thrice-given question,
“Lovest thou Me?” was restored to his place among the
twelve. His work was appointed him; he was to feed
the Lord’s flock. Then, as His last personal direction,
Jesus bade him, “Follow thou Me.”<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c015'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Lesson Learned</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Now he could appreciate the words. The lesson
Christ had given when He set a little child in the midst
of the disciples and bade them become like him, Peter
could now better understand. Knowing more fully both
his own weakness and Christ’s power, he was ready to
trust and to obey. In His strength he could follow his
Master.</p>

<p class='c014'>And at the close of his experience of labor and
sacrifice, the disciple once so unready to discern the
cross, counted it a joy to yield up his life for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>gospel, feeling only that, for him who had denied the
Lord, to die in the same manner as his Master died
was too great an honor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Miracle of Miracles</i></div>

<p class='c014'>A miracle of divine tenderness was Peter’s transformation.
It is a life-lesson to all who seek to follow in
the steps of the Master Teacher.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>Jesus reproved His disciples, He warned and cautioned
them; but John and Peter and their brethren did
not leave Him. Notwithstanding the reproofs, they
chose to be with Jesus. And the Saviour did not,
because of their errors, withdraw from them. He takes
men as they are, with all their faults and weaknesses, and
trains them for His service, if they will be disciplined
and taught by Him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Judas</i></div>

<p class='c014'>But there was one of the twelve to whom, until very
near the close of His work, Christ spoke no word of
direct reproof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>An Element of Antagonism</i></div>

<p class='c014'>With Judas an element of antagonism was introduced
among the disciples. In connecting himself with Jesus
he had responded to the attraction of His character
and life. He had sincerely desired a change in himself,
and had hoped to experience this through a union with
Jesus. But this desire did not become predominant.
That which ruled him was the hope of selfish benefit
in the worldly kingdom which he expected Christ to
establish. Though recognizing the divine power of the
love of Christ, Judas did not yield to its supremacy.
He continued to cherish his own judgment and opinions,
his disposition to criticize and condemn. Christ’s
motives and movements, often so far above his comprehension,
excited doubt and disapproval, and his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>questionings and ambitions were insinuated to the
disciples. Many of their contentions for supremacy,
much of their dissatisfaction with Christ’s methods,
originated with Judas.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Not Conflict, but Healing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Jesus, seeing that to antagonize was but to harden,
refrained from direct conflict. The narrowing selfishness
of Judas’ life, Christ sought to heal through contact
with His own self-sacrificing love. In His teaching
He unfolded principles that struck at the root of the
disciple’s self-centered ambitions. Lesson after lesson
was thus given, and many a time Judas realized that
his character had been portrayed, and his sin pointed
out; but he would not yield.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mercy’s pleading resisted, the impulse of evil bore
final sway. Judas, angered at an implied rebuke, and
made desperate by the disappointment of his ambitious
dreams, surrendered his soul to the demon of greed,
and determined upon the betrayal of his Master. From
the Passover chamber, the joy of Christ’s presence, and
the light of immortal hope, he went forth to his evil
work,—into the outer darkness, where hope was not.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Love Unfailing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“Jesus knew from the beginning who they were
that believed not, and who should betray Him.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c015'><sup>[111]</sup></a> Yet,
knowing all, He had withheld no pleading of mercy or
gift of love.</p>

<p class='c014'>Seeing the danger of Judas, He had brought him
close to Himself, within the inner circle of His chosen
and trusted disciples. Day after day, when the burden
lay heaviest upon His own heart, He had borne the
pain of continual contact with that stubborn, suspicious,
brooding spirit; He had witnessed and labored
to counteract among His disciples that continuous,
secret, and subtle antagonism. And all this that no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>possible saving influence might be lacking to that
imperiled soul!</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Warning to the Eleven</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Goal of Worldly Wisdom</i></div>

<p class='c014'>So far as Judas himself was concerned, Christ’s work
of love had been without avail. But not so as regards
his fellow-disciples. To them it was a lesson of lifelong
influence. Ever would its example of tenderness and
long-suffering mould their intercourse with the tempted
and the erring. And it had other lessons. At the
ordination of the twelve, the disciples had greatly
desired that Judas should become one of their number;
and they had counted his accession an event of much
promise to the apostolic band. He had come more
into contact with the world than they, he was a man of
good address, of discernment and executive ability, and,
having a high estimate of his own qualifications, he had
led the disciples to hold him in the same regard. But
the methods he desired to introduce into Christ’s work
were based upon worldly principles and were controlled
by worldly policy. They looked to the securing of
worldly recognition and honor,—to the obtaining of the
kingdom of this world. The working out of these
desires in the life of Judas, helped the disciples to
understand the antagonism between the principle of
self-aggrandizement and Christ’s principle of humility
and self-sacrifice,—the principle of the spiritual kingdom.
In the fate of Judas they saw the end to which
self-serving tends.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Results of Christ’s Training</i></div>

<p class='c014'>For these disciples the mission of Christ finally
accomplished its purpose. Little by little His example
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and His lessons of self-abnegation moulded their characters.
His death destroyed their hope of worldly
greatness. The fall of Peter, the apostasy of Judas,
their own failure in forsaking Christ in His anguish
and peril, swept away their self-sufficiency. They saw
their own weakness; they saw something of the greatness
of the work committed to them; they felt their
need of their Master’s guidance at every step.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Self-Distrust</i></div>

<p class='c014'>They knew that His personal presence was no
longer to be with them, and they recognized, as they
had never recognized before, the value of the opportunities
that had been theirs to walk and talk with the
Sent of God. Many of His lessons, when spoken, they
had not appreciated or understood; now they longed to
recall these lessons, to hear again His words. With
what joy now came back to them His assurance:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I
go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
but if I depart, I will send Him.” “All things that I
have heard of My Father I have made known unto
you.” And “the Comforter&nbsp;... whom the
Father will send in My name, He shall teach you
all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you.”<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c015'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Teacher of Truth</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“All things that the Father hath are Mine.” “When
He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into
all truth.... He shall receive of Mine, and shall
show it unto you.”<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c015'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The disciples had seen Christ ascend from among
them on the Mount of Olives. And as the heavens
received Him, there had come back to them His parting
promise, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
of the world.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c015'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Faith’s Assurance</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>They knew that His sympathies were with them still.
They knew that they had a representative, an advocate,
at the throne of God. In the name of Jesus they presented
their petitions, repeating His promise, “Whatsoever
ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will
give it you.”<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c015'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Higher and higher they extended the hand of faith,
with the mighty argument, “It is Christ that died, yea
rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand
of God, who also maketh intercession for us.”<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c015'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Faithful to His promise, the Divine One, exalted in
the heavenly courts, imparted of His fulness to His
followers on earth. His enthronement at God’s right
hand was signalized by the outpouring of the Spirit
upon His disciples.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Final Preparation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>By the work of Christ these disciples had been led
to feel their need of the Spirit; under the Spirit’s teaching
they received their final preparation, and went forth
to their life-work.</p>

<p class='c014'>No longer were they ignorant and uncultured. No
longer were they a collection of independent units or of
discordant and conflicting elements. No longer were
their hopes set on worldly greatness. They were of
“one accord,” of “one mind and one soul.” Christ
filled their thoughts. The advancement of His kingdom
was their aim. In mind and character they had
become like their Master; and men “took knowledge
of them, that they had been with Jesus.”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c015'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Work That Shook the World</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Then was there such a revelation of the glory of
Christ as had never before been witnessed by mortal
man. Multitudes who had reviled His name and
despised His power confessed themselves disciples of
the Crucified. Through the co-operation of the divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Spirit the labors of the humble men whom Christ had
chosen, stirred the world. To every nation under
heaven was the gospel carried in a single generation.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>I Am with You Alway</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>The same Spirit that in His stead was sent to be the
instructor of His first co-workers, Christ has commissioned
to be the instructor of His co-workers to-day.
“Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
world,”<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c015'><sup>[119]</sup></a> is His promise.</p>

<p class='c014'>The presence of the same Guide in educational work
to-day will produce the same results as of old. This is
the end to which true education tends; this is the work
that God designs it to accomplish.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Pervading Life</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Upon all created things is seen the impress of the
Deity. Nature testifies of God. The susceptible
mind, brought in contact with the miracle and mystery
of the universe, can not but recognize the working of
infinite power. Not by its own inherent energy does
the earth produce its bounties, and year by year continue
its motion around the sun. An unseen hand
guides the planets in their circuit of the heavens. A
mysterious life pervades all nature,—a life that sustains
the unnumbered worlds throughout immensity; that
lives in the insect atom which floats in the summer
breeze; that wings the flight of the swallow, and feeds
the young ravens which cry; that brings the bud to
blossom, and the flower to fruit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Universality of Law</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The same power that upholds nature, is working
also in man. The same great laws that guide alike the
star and the atom, control human life. The laws that
govern the heart’s action, regulating the flow of the
current of life to the body, are the laws of the mighty
Intelligence that has the jurisdiction of the soul. From
Him all life proceeds. Only in harmony with Him can
be found its true sphere of action. For all the objects
of His creation the condition is the same,—a life sustained
by receiving the life of God, a life exercised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>in harmony with the Creator’s will. To transgress
His law, physical, mental, or moral, is to place one’s
self out of harmony with the universe, to introduce
discord, anarchy, ruin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nature’s Witness</i></div>

<p class='c014'>To him who learns thus to interpret its teachings,
all nature becomes illuminated; the world is a lesson-book,
life a school. The unity of man with nature and
with God, the universal dominion of law, the results of
transgression, can not fail of impressing the mind and
moulding the character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Child’s Teacher</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Opportunity for Nature Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'>These are lessons that our children need to learn.
To the little child, not yet capable of learning from the
printed page or of being introduced to the routine of
the schoolroom, nature presents an unfailing source of
instruction and delight. The heart not yet hardened by
contact with evil is quick to recognize the Presence that
pervades all created things. The ear as yet undulled
by the world’s clamor is attentive to the Voice that
speaks through nature’s utterances. And for those of
older years, needing continually its silent reminders of
the spiritual and eternal, nature’s teaching will be no
less a source of pleasure and of instruction. As the
dwellers in Eden learned from nature’s pages, as Moses
discerned God’s handwriting on the Arabian plains and
mountains, and the Child Jesus on the hillsides of Nazareth,
so the children of to-day may learn of Him. The
unseen is illustrated by the seen. On everything upon
the earth, from the loftiest tree of the forest to the
lichen that clings to the rock, from the boundless ocean
to the tiniest shell on the shore, they may behold the
image and superscription of God.</p>

<p class='c014'>So far as possible, let the child from his earliest
years be placed where this wonderful lesson-book shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>be open before him. Let him behold the glorious
scenes painted by the great Master Artist upon the
shifting canvas of the heavens, let him become acquainted
with the wonders of earth and sea, let him watch the
unfolding mysteries of the changing seasons, and, in all
His works, learn of the Creator.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Antagonistic Forces</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In no other way can the foundation of a true education
be so firmly and surely laid. Yet even the child,
as he comes in contact with nature, will see cause for
perplexity. He can not but recognize the working of
antagonistic forces. It is here that nature needs an
interpreter. Looking upon the evil manifest even in
the natural world, all have the same sorrowful lesson
to learn,—“An enemy hath done this.”<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c015'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Interpreter of Nature</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Only in the light that shines from Calvary can
nature’s teaching be read aright. Through the story
of Bethlehem and the cross let it be shown how good
is to conquer evil, and how every blessing that comes to
us is a gift of redemption.</p>

<p class='c014'>In brier and thorn, in thistle and tare, is represented
the evil that blights and mars. In singing bird and
opening blossom, in rain and sunshine, in summer
breeze and gentle dew, in ten thousand objects in
nature, from the oak of the forest to the violet that
blossoms at its root, is seen the love that restores.
And nature still speaks to us of God’s goodness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Thoughts of Peace</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith
the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil.”<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c015'><sup>[121]</sup></a> This is
the message that, in the light from the cross, may be
read upon all the face of nature. The heavens declare
His glory, and the earth is full of His riches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Christ’s Object Teaching</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The great Teacher brought His hearers in contact
with nature, that they might listen to the voice
which speaks in all created things; and as their hearts
became tender and their minds receptive, He helped
them to interpret the spiritual teaching of the scenes
upon which their eyes rested. The parables, by means
of which He loved to teach lessons of truth, show how
open His spirit was to the influences of nature, and how
He delighted to gather the spiritual teaching from the
surroundings of daily life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Adapted to Every Hearer</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The birds of the air, the lilies of the field, the sower
and the seed, the shepherd and the sheep,—with these
Christ illustrated immortal truth. He drew illustrations
also from the events of life, facts of experience familiar
to the hearers,—the leaven, the hid treasure, the pearl,
the fishing net, the lost coin, the prodigal son, the houses
on the rock and the sand. In His lessons there was
something to interest every mind, to appeal to every
heart. Thus the daily task, instead of being a mere
round of toil, bereft of higher thoughts, was brightened
and uplifted by constant reminders of the spiritual and
the unseen.</p>

<p class='c014'>So we should teach. Let the children learn to see
in nature an expression of the love and the wisdom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>God; let the thought of Him be linked with bird and
flower and tree; let all things seen become to them the
interpreters of the unseen, and all the events of life be a
means of divine teaching.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Unity of Law</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As they learn thus to study the lessons in all created
things, and in all life’s experiences, show that the same
laws which govern the things of nature and the events
of life are to control us; that they are given for our
good; and that only in obedience to them can we find
true happiness and success.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Law of Ministry</i></div>

<p class='c014'>All things both in heaven and in earth declare that
the great law of life is a law of service. The infinite
Father ministers to the life of every living thing. Christ
came to the earth “as he that serveth.”<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c015'><sup>[122]</sup></a> The angels
are “ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them
who shall be heirs of salvation.”<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c015'><sup>[123]</sup></a> The same law of
service is written upon all things in nature. The birds
of the air, the beasts of the field, the trees of the forest,
the leaves, the grass, and the flowers, the sun in the
heavens and the stars of light,—all have their ministry.
Lake and ocean, river and water-spring,—each takes to
give.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gaining by Giving</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As each thing in nature ministers thus to the world’s
life, it also secures its own. “Give, and it shall be given
unto you,”<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c015'><sup>[124]</sup></a> is the lesson written no less surely in nature
than in the pages of Holy Writ.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the hillsides and the plains open a channel for the
mountain stream to reach the sea, that which they give
is repaid a hundredfold. The stream that goes singing
on its way leaves behind its gift of beauty and fruitfulness.
Through the fields, bare and brown under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>summer’s heat, a line of verdure marks the river’s
course; every noble tree, every bud, every blossom, a
witness to the recompense God’s grace decrees to all
who become its channels to the world.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Laws of Growth</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Of the almost innumerable lessons taught in the
varied processes of growth, some of the most precious
are conveyed in the Saviour’s parable of the growing
seed. It has lessons for old and young.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
seed into the ground; and should sleep, and rise night
and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he
knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of
herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full
corn in the ear.”<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c015'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Divine Agency in Growth</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The seed has in itself a germinating principle, a principle
that God Himself has implanted; yet if left to itself
the seed would have no power to spring up. Man has
his part to act in promoting the growth of the grain;
but there is a point beyond which he can accomplish
nothing. He must depend upon One who has connected
the sowing and the reaping by wonderful links of His
own omnipotent power.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is life in the seed, there is power in the soil;
but unless infinite power is exercised day and night, the
seed will yield no return. The showers of rain must
refresh the thirsty fields; the sun must impart warmth;
electricity must be conveyed to the buried seed. The
life which the Creator has implanted, He alone can call
forth. Every seed grows, every plant develops, by the
power of God.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The seed is the word of God.” “As the earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the
things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the Lord
God will cause righteousness and praise to spring
forth.”<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c015'><sup>[126]</sup></a> As in the natural, so in the spiritual sowing;
the power that alone can produce life is from God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sowing in Faith</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The work of the sower is a work of faith. The
mystery of the germination and growth of the seed he
can not understand; but he has confidence in the agencies
by which God causes vegetation to flourish. He
casts away the seed, expecting to gather it many-fold in
an abundant harvest. So parents and teachers are to
labor, expecting a harvest from the seed they sow.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>God’s Covenant for the Harvest</i></div>

<p class='c014'>For a time the good seed may lie unnoticed in the
heart, giving no evidence that it has taken root; but
afterward, as the Spirit of God breathes on the soul, the
hidden seed springs up, and at last brings forth fruit.
In our life-work we know not which shall prosper, this
or that. This question it is not for us to settle. “In
the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold
not thine hand.”<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c015'><sup>[127]</sup></a> God’s great covenant declares that
“while the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest&nbsp;...
shall not cease.”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c015'><sup>[128]</sup></a> In the confidence of this promise the
husbandman tills and sows. Not less confidently are
we, in the spiritual sowing, to labor, trusting His assurance:
“So shall My word be that goeth forth out of
My mouth; it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall
accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in
the thing whereto I sent it.” “He that goeth forth and
weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come
again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.”<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c015'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The germination of the seed represents the beginning
of spiritual life, and the development of the plant is
a figure of the development of character. There can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>no life without growth. The plant must either grow or
die. As its growth is silent and imperceptible, but continuous,
so is the growth of character. At every stage
of development our life may be perfect; yet if God’s
purpose for us is fulfilled, there will be constant advancement.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Conditions of Growth</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The plant grows by receiving that which God has
provided to sustain its life. So spiritual growth is
attained through co-operation with divine agencies.
As the plant takes root in the soil, so we are to take
root in Christ. As the plant receives the sunshine, the
dew, and the rain, so are we to receive the Holy Spirit.
If our hearts are stayed upon Christ, He will come unto
us “as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the
earth.” As the Sun of Righteousness, He will arise
upon us “with healing in His wings.” We shall “grow
as the lily.” We shall “revive as the corn, and grow
as the vine.”<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c015'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Fruit-Bearing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The wheat develops, “first the blade, then the ear,
after that the full corn in the ear.”<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c015'><sup>[131]</sup></a> The object of the
husbandman in the sowing of the seed and the culture
of the plant, is the production of grain,—bread for the
hungry, and seed for future harvests. So the divine
Husbandman looks for a harvest. He is seeking to
reproduce Himself in the hearts and lives of His followers,
that through them He may be reproduced in
other hearts and lives.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Lesson in Child-Training</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Natural Development</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The gradual development of the plant from the seed
is an object-lesson in child-training. There is “first the
blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.”<a href='#f131' class='c015'><sup>[131]</sup></a>
He who gave this parable created the tiny seed, gave
it its vital properties, and ordained the laws that govern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>its growth. And the truths taught by the parable were
made a reality in His own life. He, the Majesty of
heaven, the King of glory, became a babe in Bethlehem,
and for a time represented the helpless infant in its
mother’s care. In childhood He spoke and acted as
a child, honoring His parents, and carrying out their
wishes in helpful ways. But from the first dawning of
intelligence He was constantly growing in grace and in
a knowledge of truth.</p>

<p class='c014'>Parents and teachers should aim so to cultivate the
tendencies of the youth that at each stage of life they
may represent the beauty appropriate to that period,
unfolding naturally, as do the plants in the garden.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Simplicity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The little ones should be educated in childlike simplicity.
They should be trained to be content with the
small, helpful duties and the pleasures and experiences
natural to their years. Childhood answers to the blade
in the parable, and the blade has a beauty peculiarly its
own. Children should not be forced into a precocious
maturity, but as long as possible should retain the freshness
and grace of their early years. The more quiet
and simple the life of the child,—the more free from
artificial excitement and the more in harmony with
nature,—the more favorable it is to physical and mental
vigor and to spiritual strength.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Miracle of the Harvest</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the Saviour’s miracle of feeding the five thousand
is illustrated the working of God’s power in the production
of the harvest. Jesus draws aside the veil from
the world of nature, and reveals the creative energy that
is constantly exercised for our good. In multiplying
the seed cast into the ground, He who multiplied the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>loaves is working a miracle every day. It is by a
miracle that He constantly feeds millions from earth’s
harvest-fields. Men are called upon to co-operate with
Him in the care of the grain and the preparation of the
loaf, and because of this they lose sight of the divine
agency. The working of His power is ascribed to
natural causes or to human instrumentality, and too
often His gifts are perverted to selfish uses, and made
a curse instead of a blessing. God is seeking to change
all this. He desires that our dull senses shall be quickened
to discern His merciful kindness, that His gifts
may be to us the blessing that He intended.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Partakers of the Life of God</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is the word of God, the impartation of His life,
that gives life to the seed; and of that life, we, in eating
the grain, become partakers. This God desires us to
discern; He desires that even in receiving our daily
bread we may recognize His agency, and may be
brought into closer fellowship with Him.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>We Reap What We Sow</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Life’s Harvest, Character</i></div>

<p class='c014'>By the laws of God in nature, effect follows cause
with unvarying certainty. The reaping testifies to the
sowing. Here no pretense is tolerated. Men may
deceive their fellow-men, and may receive praise and
compensation for service which they have not rendered.
But in nature there can be no deception. On the
unfaithful husbandman the harvest passes sentence of
condemnation. And in the highest sense this is true
also in the spiritual realm. It is in appearance, not in
reality, that evil succeeds. The child who plays truant
from school, the youth who is slothful in his studies, the
clerk or apprentice who fails of serving the interests of
his employer, the man in any business or profession who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>is untrue to his highest responsibilities, may flatter himself
that, so long as the wrong is concealed, he is gaining
an advantage. But not so; he is cheating himself.
The harvest of life is character, and it is this that determines
destiny, both for this life and for the life to come.</p>

<p class='c014'>The harvest is a reproduction of the seed sown.
Every seed yields fruit “after its kind.” So it is with
the traits of character we cherish. Selfishness, self-love,
self-esteem, self-indulgence, reproduce themselves, and
the end is wretchedness and ruin. “He that soweth to
his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that
soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.”<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c015'><sup>[132]</sup></a>
Love, sympathy, and kindness yield fruitage
of blessing, a harvest that is imperishable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Increase from Sowing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the harvest the seed is multiplied. A single
grain of wheat, increased by repeated sowings, would
cover a whole land with golden sheaves. So widespread
may be the influence of a single life, of even a
single act.</p>

<p class='c014'>What deeds of love the memory of that alabaster
box broken for Christ’s anointing has through the long
centuries prompted! What countless gifts that contribution,
by a poor unnamed widow, of “two mites, which
make a farthing,”<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c015'><sup>[133]</sup></a> has brought to the Saviour’s cause!</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Freely Give</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>The lesson of seed-sowing teaches liberality. “He
which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he
which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.”<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c015'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The Lord says, “Blessed are ye that sow beside
all waters.”<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c015'><sup>[135]</sup></a> To sow beside all waters means to
give wherever our help is needed. This will not
tend to poverty. “He which soweth bountifully shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>reap also bountifully.” By casting it away the sower
multiplies his seed. So by imparting we increase our
blessings. God’s promise assures a sufficiency, that
we may continue to give.</p>

<p class='c014'>More than this: as we impart the blessings of this
life, gratitude in the recipient prepares the heart to
receive spiritual truth, and a harvest is produced unto
life everlasting.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Life through Death</i></div>

<p class='c014'>By the casting of grain into the earth, the Saviour
represents His sacrifice for us. “Except a corn of
wheat fall into the ground and die,” He says, “it
abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much
fruit.”<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c015'><sup>[136]</sup></a> Only through the sacrifice of Christ, the Seed,
could fruit be brought forth for the kingdom of God.
In accordance with the law of the vegetable kingdom,
life is the result of His death.</p>

<p class='c014'>So with all who bring forth fruit as workers together
with Christ: self-love, self-interest, must perish; the life
must be cast into the furrow of the world’s need. But
the law of self-sacrifice is the law of self-preservation.
The husbandman preserves his grain by casting it away.
So the life that will be preserved is the life that is freely
given in service to God and man.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Symbol of the Resurrection</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The seed dies, to spring forth into new life. In
this we are taught the lesson of the resurrection. Of
the human body laid away to moulder in the grave, God
has said: “It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it
is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.”<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c015'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nature Study Made Practical</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>As parents and teachers try to teach these lessons,
the work should be made practical. Let the children
themselves prepare the soil and sow the seed. As they
work, the parent or teacher can explain the garden of
the heart, with the good or bad seed sown there, and
that as the garden must be prepared for the natural
seed, so the heart must be prepared for the seed of
truth. As the seed is cast into the ground, they can
teach the lesson of Christ’s death; and as the blade
springs up, the truth of the resurrection. As the plant
grows, the correspondence between the natural and the
spiritual sowing may be continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>The youth should be instructed in a similar way.
From the tilling of the soil, lessons may constantly be
learned. No one settles upon a raw piece of land with
the expectation that it will at once yield a harvest.
Diligent, persevering labor must be put forth in the
preparation of the soil, the sowing of the seed, and the
culture of the crop. So it must be in the spiritual
sowing. The garden of the heart must be cultivated.
The soil must be broken up by repentance. The evil
growths that choke the good grain must be uprooted.
As soil once overgrown with thorns can be reclaimed
only by diligent labor, so the evil tendencies of the
heart can be overcome only by earnest effort in the
name and strength of Christ.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Obedience to Law</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Development of Character</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the cultivation of the soil the thoughtful worker
will find that treasures little dreamed of are opening
up before him. No one can succeed in agriculture or
gardening without attention to the laws involved. The
special needs of every variety of plant must be studied.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Different varieties require different soil and cultivation,
and compliance with the laws governing each is the
condition of success. The attention required in transplanting,
that not even a root-fiber shall be crowded or
misplaced, the care of the young plants, the pruning
and watering, the shielding from frost at night and sun
by day, keeping out weeds, disease, and insect-pests,
the training and arranging, not only teach important
lessons concerning the development of character, but
the work itself is a means of development. In cultivating
carefulness, patience, attention to detail, obedience
to law, it imparts a most essential training. The
constant contact with the mystery of life and the loveliness
of nature, as well as the tenderness called forth in
ministering to these beautiful objects of God’s creation,
tends to quicken the mind and refine and elevate the
character; and the lessons taught prepare the worker
to deal more successfully with other minds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Ministry of Healing</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>God’s healing power runs all through nature. If a
tree is cut, if a human being is wounded or breaks
a bone, nature begins at once to repair the injury.
Even before the need exists, the healing agencies are
in readiness; and as soon as a part is wounded, every
energy is bent to the work of restoration. So it is in
the spiritual realm. Before sin created the need, God
had provided the remedy. Every soul that yields to
temptation is wounded, bruised, by the adversary; but
wherever there is sin, there is the Saviour. It is Christ’s
work “to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance
to the captives,&nbsp;... to set at liberty them that are
bruised.”<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c015'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Suggestive Figure</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Only Love Can Restore</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In this work we are to co-operate. “If a man be
overtaken in a fault,&nbsp;... restore such a one.”<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c015'><sup>[139]</sup></a>
The word here translated “restore” means to put in
joint, as a dislocated bone. How suggestive the figure!
He who falls into error or sin is thrown out of relation
to everything about him. He may realize his error, and
be filled with remorse; but he can not recover himself.
He is in confusion and perplexity, worsted and helpless.
He is to be reclaimed, healed, re-established. “Ye
which are spiritual, restore such a one.” Only the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>love that flows from the heart of Christ can heal.
Only he in whom that love flows, even as the sap in
the tree or the blood in the body, can restore the
wounded soul.</p>

<p class='c014'>Love’s agencies have wonderful power, for they are
divine. The soft answer that “turneth away wrath,”
the love that “suffereth long, and is kind,” the charity
that “covereth a multitude of sins,”<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c015'><sup>[140]</sup></a>—would we learn
the lesson, with what power for healing would our
lives be gifted! How life would be transformed, and
the earth become a very likeness and foretaste of
heaven!</p>

<p class='c014'>These precious lessons may be so simply taught as
to be understood, even by little children. The heart of
the child is tender and easily impressed; and when we
who are older become “as little children;”<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c015'><sup>[141]</sup></a> when we
learn the simplicity and gentleness and tender love of
the Saviour, we shall not find it difficult to touch the
hearts of the little ones, and teach them love’s ministry
of healing.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Perfection in Little Things</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Perfection exists in the least as well as in the
greatest of the works of God. The hand that hung
the worlds in space is the hand that fashions the
flowers of the field. Examine under the microscope
the smallest and commonest of wayside blossoms, and
note in all its parts the exquisite beauty and completeness.
So in the humblest lot true excellence may be
found; the commonest tasks, wrought with loving faithfulness,
are beautiful in God’s sight. Conscientious
attention to the little things will make us workers
together with Him, and win for us His commendation
who seeth and knoweth all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Rainbow</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>The rainbow spanning the heavens with its arch of
light is a token of “the everlasting covenant between
God and every living creature.”<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c015'><sup>[142]</sup></a> And the rainbow
encircling the throne on high is also a token to God’s
children of His covenant of peace.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the bow in the cloud results from the union of
sunshine and shower, so the bow above God’s throne
represents the union of His mercy and His justice. To
the sinful but repentant soul God says, Live thou; “I
have found a ransom.”<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c015'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“As I have sworn that the waters of Noah should
no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I
would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. For
the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed;
but My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither
shall the covenant of My peace be removed, saith the
Lord that hath mercy on thee.”<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c015'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The stars also have a message of good cheer for
every human being. In those hours that come to all,
when the heart is faint, and temptation presses sore;
when obstacles seem insurmountable, life’s aims impossible
of achievement, its fair promises like apples of
Sodom, where, then, can such courage and steadfastness

learn from the stars in their untroubled course?</p>

the parched, desolate plain; and the traveler, ready to
die, urges his failing steps to the cool shade and the
life-giving water.</p>

<p class='c014'>The tree of the desert is a symbol of what God
means the life of His children in this world to be.
They are to guide weary souls, full of unrest, and ready
to perish in the desert of sin, to the living water. They

<p class='c014'>The wide, deep river, that offers a highway for the
traffic and travel of nations, is valued as a world-wide
benefit; but what of the little rills that help to form this
noble stream? Were it not for them, the river would
disappear. Upon them its very existence depends. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>men called to lead in some great work are honored as
if its success were due to them alone; but that success
required the faithful co-operation of humbler workers
almost without number,—workers of whom the world
knows nothing. Tasks uncommended, labor without
recognition, is the lot of most of the world’s toilers.
And in such a lot many are filled with discontent.
They feel that life is wasted. But the little rill that
makes its noiseless way through grove and meadow,
bearing health and fertility and beauty, is as useful in
its way as the broad river. And in contributing to the
river’s life, it helps achieve that which alone it could
never have accomplished.</p>

<p class='c014'>The lesson is one needed by many. Talent is too
much idolized, and station too much coveted. There
are too many who will do nothing unless they are
recognized as leaders; too many who must receive
praise, or they have no interest to labor. What we
need to learn is faithfulness in making the utmost use
of the powers and opportunities we have, and contentment
in the lot to which Heaven assigns us.</p>

Storm-clouds shut in this mighty bird of the forest,
their dark masses separating her from the sunny heights
where she has made her home. Her efforts to escape
seem fruitless. She dashes to and fro, beating the air
with her strong wings, and waking the mountain echoes
with her cries. At length, with a note of triumph, she
darts upward, and, piercing the clouds, is once more in
the clear sunlight, with the darkness and tempest far
beneath. So we may be surrounded with difficulties,
discouragement, and darkness. Falsehood, calamity,
injustice, shut us in. There are clouds that we can not
dispel. We battle with circumstances in vain. There
is one, and but one, way of escape. The mists and fogs
cling to the earth; beyond the clouds God’s light is

Self-reliance, from the tree that, growing alone on plain

earth, and in its rugged strength defies the tempest.
The power of early influence, from the gnarled, shapeless
trunk, bent as a sapling, to which no earthly power
can afterward restore its lost symmetry. The secret of
a holy life, from the water-lily, that, on the bosom of
some slimy pool, surrounded by weeds and rubbish,
strikes down its channeled stem to the pure sands

<div class='sidenote'><i>Teach Children to Observe</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Thus while the children and youth gain a knowledge
of facts from teachers and text-books, let them
learn to draw lessons and discern truth for themselves.
In their gardening, question them as to what they
learn from the care of their plants. As they look on a
beautiful landscape, ask them why God clothed the
fields and woods with such lovely and varied hues.
Why was not all colored a somber brown? When
they gather the flowers, lead them to think why He
spared us the beauty of these wanderers from Eden.
Teach them to notice the evidences everywhere manifest
in nature of God’s thought for us, the wonderful
adaptation of all things to our need and happiness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nature a Key to the Bible</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Many illustrations from nature are used by the Bible

Holy Spirit, more fully to understand the lessons of
God’s word. It is thus that nature becomes a key
to the treasure-house of the word.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Study Similitudes</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Children should be encouraged to search out in
nature the objects that illustrate Bible teachings, and
to trace in the Bible the similitudes drawn from nature.
They should search out, both in nature and in Holy
Writ, every object representing Christ, and those also
that He employed in illustrating truth. Thus may they
learn to see Him in tree and vine, in lily and rose, in
sun and star. They may learn to hear His voice in
the song of birds, in the sighing of the trees, in the
rolling thunder, and in the music of the sea. And
every object in nature will repeat to them His precious
lessons.</p>

<p class='c014'>To those who thus acquaint themselves with Christ,
the earth will nevermore be a lonely and desolate place.
It will be their Father’s house, filled with the presence

<div class='sidenote'><i>Effort in Bible Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Bible contains all the principles that men need
to understand in order to be fitted either for this life
or for the life to come. And these principles may be
understood by all. No one with a spirit to appreciate
its teaching can read a single passage from the Bible
without gaining from it some helpful thought. But the
most valuable teaching of the Bible is not to be gained
by occasional or disconnected study. Its great system
of truth is not so presented as to be discerned by the
hasty or careless reader. Many of its treasures lie far
beneath the surface, and can be obtained only by diligent
research and continuous effort. The truths that
go to make up the great whole must be searched out
and gathered up, “here a little, and there a little.”<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c015'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Perfect Whole</i></div>

<p class='c014'>When thus searched out and brought together, they
will be found to be perfectly fitted to one another. Each
Gospel is a supplement to the others, every prophecy an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>explanation of another, every truth a development of
some other truth. The types of the Jewish economy
are made plain by the gospel. Every principle in the
word of God has its place, every fact its bearing. And
the complete structure, in design and execution, bears
testimony to its Author. Such a structure no mind but
that of the Infinite could conceive or fashion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Intellectual Discipline</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In searching out the various parts and studying their
relationship, the highest faculties of the human mind are
called into intense activity. No one can engage in such
study without developing mental power.</p>

<p class='c014'>And not alone in searching out truth and bringing
it together does the mental value of Bible study consist.
It consists also in the effort required to grasp the
themes presented. The mind occupied with commonplace
matters only, becomes dwarfed and enfeebled. If
never tasked to comprehend grand and far-reaching
truths, it after a time loses the power of growth. As
a safeguard against this degeneracy, and a stimulus to
development, nothing else can equal the study of God’s
word. As a means of intellectual training, the Bible is
more effective than any other book, or all other books
combined. The greatness of its themes, the dignified
simplicity of its utterances, the beauty of its imagery,
quicken and uplift the thoughts as nothing else can.
No other study can impart such mental power as does
the effort to grasp the stupendous truths of revelation.
The mind thus brought in contact with the thoughts
of the Infinite can not but expand and strengthen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spiritual Development</i></div>

<p class='c014'>And even greater is the power of the Bible in the
development of the spiritual nature. Man, created for
fellowship with God, can only in such fellowship find his
real life and development. Created to find in God his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>highest joy, he can find in nothing else that which can
quiet the cravings of the heart, can satisfy the hunger
and thirst of the soul. He who with sincere and
teachable spirit studies God’s word, seeking to comprehend
its truths, will be brought in touch with its
Author; and, except by his own choice, there is no
limit to the possibilities of his development.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Range of Style and Subjects</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In its wide range of style and subjects, the Bible has
something to interest every mind and appeal to every
heart. In its pages are found history the most ancient;
biography the truest to life; principles of government for
the control of the state, for the regulation of the household,—principles
that human wisdom has never equaled.
It contains philosophy the most profound, poetry the
sweetest and the most sublime, the most impassioned
and the most pathetic. Immeasurably superior in value
to the productions of any human author are the Bible
writings, even when thus considered; but of infinitely
wider scope, of infinitely greater value, are they when
viewed in their relation to the grand central thought.
Viewed in the light of this thought, every topic has a
new significance. In the most simply stated truths are
involved principles that are as high as heaven and that
compass eternity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Central Theme</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The central theme of the Bible, the theme about
which every other in the whole book clusters, is the
redemption plan, the restoration in the human soul of
the image of God. From the first intimation of hope in
the sentence pronounced in Eden to that last glorious
promise of the Revelation, “They shall see His face;
and His name shall be in their foreheads,”<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c015'><sup>[150]</sup></a> the burden
of every book and every passage of the Bible is the
unfolding of this wondrous theme,—man’s uplifting,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>power of God, “which giveth us the victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ.”<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c015'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>An Infinite Field</i></div>

<p class='c014'>He who grasps this thought has before him an infinite
field for study. He has the key that will unlock
to him the whole treasure-house of God’s word.</p>

<p class='c014'>The science of redemption is the science of all sciences;
the science that is the study of the angels and of
all the intelligences of the unfallen worlds; the science
that engages the attention of our Lord and Saviour;
the science that enters into the purpose brooded in the
mind of the Infinite,—“kept in silence through times
eternal;”<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c015'><sup>[152]</sup></a> the science that will be the study of God’s
redeemed throughout endless ages. This is the highest
study in which it is possible for man to engage. As
no other study can, it will quicken the mind and uplift
the soul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Truths Life-Begetting</i>.</div>

<p class='c014'>“The excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom
giveth life to them that have it.” “The words that I
speak unto you,” said Jesus, “they are spirit, and they
are life.” “This is life eternal, that they should know
Thee the only true God, and Him whom Thou didst
send.”<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c015'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The creative energy that called the worlds into
existence is in the word of God. This word imparts
power; it begets life. Every command is a promise;
accepted by the will, received into the soul, it brings
with it the life of the Infinite One. It transforms the
nature, and re-creates the soul in the image of God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Life-Sustaining</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The life thus imparted is in like manner sustained.
“By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God”<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c015'><sup>[154]</sup></a> shall man live.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mind, the soul, is built up by that upon which
it feeds; and it rests with us to determine upon what it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>shall be fed. It is within the power of every one to
choose the topics that shall occupy the thoughts and
shape the character. Of every human being privileged
with access to the Scriptures, God says, “I have written
to him the great things of My law.” “Call unto Me,
and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty
things, which thou knowest not.”<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c015'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Possibilities of Companionship</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Not a Stranger</i></div>

<p class='c014'>With the word of God in his hands, every human
being, wherever his lot in life may be cast, may have
such companionship as he shall choose. In its pages
he may hold converse with the noblest and best of the
human race, and may listen to the voice of the Eternal
as He speaks with men. As he studies and meditates
upon the themes into which “the angels desire to
look,”<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c015'><sup>[156]</sup></a> he may have their companionship. He may
follow the steps of the heavenly Teacher, and listen to
His words as when He taught on mountain and plain
and sea. He may dwell in this world in the atmosphere
of heaven, imparting to earth’s sorrowing and tempted
ones thoughts of hope and longings for holiness; himself
coming closer and still closer into fellowship with the
Unseen; like him of old who walked with God, drawing
nearer and nearer the threshold of the eternal world,
until the portals shall open, and he shall enter there.
He will find himself no stranger. The voices that will
greet him are the voices of the holy ones, who, unseen,
were on earth his companions,—voices that here he
learned to distinguish and to love. He who through
the word of God has lived in fellowship with heaven,
will find himself at home in heaven’s companionship.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Harmony of Nature and Revelation</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Since the book of nature and the book of revelation
bear the impress of the same master mind, they can
not but speak in harmony. By different methods, and
in different languages, they witness to the same great
truths. Science is ever discovering new wonders;
but she brings from her research nothing that, rightly
understood, conflicts with divine revelation. The book
of nature and the written word shed light upon each
other. They make us acquainted with God by teaching
us something of the laws through which He works.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Evolution of the Earth</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Inferences erroneously drawn from facts observed in
nature have, however, led to supposed conflict between
science and revelation; and in the effort to restore
harmony, interpretations of Scripture have been adopted
that undermine and destroy the force of the word of
God. Geology has been thought to contradict the
literal interpretation of the Mosaic record of the creation.
Millions of years, it is claimed, were required
for the evolution of the earth from chaos; and in order
to accommodate the Bible to this supposed revelation
of science, the days of creation are assumed to have
been vast, indefinite periods, covering thousands or even
millions of years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Bible Record of the Creation</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Such a conclusion is wholly uncalled for. The
Bible record is in harmony with itself and with the
teaching of nature. Of the first day employed in the
work of creation is given the record, “The evening and
the morning were the first day.”<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c015'><sup>[157]</sup></a> And the same in
substance is said of each of the first six days of creation
week. Each of these periods Inspiration declares to
have been a day consisting of evening and morning,
like every other day since that time. In regard to
the work of creation itself the divine testimony is, “He
spake, and it was; He commanded, and it stood fast.”<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c015'><sup>[158]</sup></a>
With Him who could thus call into existence unnumbered
worlds, how long a time would be required for the
evolution of the earth from chaos? In order to account
for His works, must we do violence to His word?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Changes at the Flood</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is true that remains found in the earth testify to
the existence of men, animals, and plants much larger
than any now known. These are regarded as proving
the existence of vegetable and animal life prior to the
time of the Mosaic record. But concerning these things
Bible history furnishes ample explanation. Before the
flood, the development of vegetable and animal life
was immeasurably superior to that which has since
been known. At the flood the surface of the earth
was broken up, marked changes took place, and in
the re-formation of the earth’s crust were preserved
many evidences of the life previously existing. The
vast forests buried in the earth at the time of the flood,
and since changed to coal, form the extensive coal
fields, and yield the supplies of oil, that minister to
our comfort and convenience to-day. These things,
as they are brought to light, are so many witnesses
mutely testifying to the truth of the word of God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Evolution of Man</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Akin to the theory concerning the evolution of the
earth, is that which attributes to an ascending line of
germs, mollusks, and quadrupeds the evolution of man,
the crowning glory of the creation.</p>

<p class='c014'>When consideration is given to man’s opportunities
for research; how brief his life; how limited his sphere
of action; how restricted his vision; how frequent and
how great the errors in his conclusions, especially as
concerns the events thought to antedate Bible history;
how often the supposed deductions of science are revised
or cast aside; with what readiness the assumed period
of the earth’s development is from time to time increased
or diminished by millions of years; and how the theories
advanced by different scientists conflict with one another,—considering
all this, shall we, for the privilege of tracing
our descent from germs and mollusks and apes,
consent to cast away that statement of Holy Writ, so
grand in its simplicity, “God created man in His own
image, in the image of God created He him”?<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c015'><sup>[159]</sup></a> Shall
we reject that genealogical record,—prouder than any
treasured in the courts of kings,—“which was the son
of Adam, which was the son of God”?<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c015'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Divine Working in Nature</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Rightly understood, both the revelations of science
and the experiences of life are in harmony with the
testimony of Scripture to the constant working of God
in nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the hymn recorded by Nehemiah, the Levites
sung, “Thou, even Thou, art Lord alone; Thou hast
made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host,
the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and
all that is therein, and Thou preservest them all.”<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c015'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The All-Embracing Providence</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As regards this earth, Scripture declares the work
of creation to have been completed. “The works were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>finished from the foundation of the world.”<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c015'><sup>[162]</sup></a> But the
power of God is still exercised in upholding the objects
of His creation. It is not because the mechanism once
set in motion continues to act by its own inherent energy
that the pulse beats, and breath follows breath. Every
breath, every pulsation of the heart, is an evidence of
the care of Him in whom we live and move and have
our being. From the smallest insect to man, every
living creature is daily dependent upon His providence.</p>

No intangible principle, no impersonal essence or mere
abstraction, can satisfy the needs and longings of human
beings in this life of struggle with sin and sorrow and
pain. It is not enough to believe in law and force, in
things that have no pity, and never hear the cry for
help. We need to know of an almighty arm that will

<p class='c014'>“He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be

vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.”<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c015'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“The borrower is servant to the lender.”<a href='#f188' class='c015'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for
it; and he that hateth suretyship is sure.”<a href='#f188' class='c015'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“Remove not the old landmark; and enter not
into the fields of the fatherless; for their Redeemer is
mighty; He shall plead their cause with thee.” “He
that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he
that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.”

<div class='sidenote'><i>Basis of Confidence</i></div>

<p class='c014'>These are principles with which are bound up the
well-being of society, of both secular and religious
associations. It is these principles that give security
to property and life. For all that makes confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and co-operation possible, the world is indebted to the
law of God, as given in His word, and as still traced,
in lines often obscure and well-nigh obliterated, in the
hearts of men.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Best Capital</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The psalmist’s words, “The law of Thy mouth is
better unto me than thousands of gold and silver,”<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c015'><sup>[190]</sup></a>
state that which is true from other than a religious
point of view. They state an absolute truth, and one
that is recognized in the business world. Even in this
age of passion for money-getting, when competition is
so sharp, and methods are so unscrupulous, it is still
widely acknowledged that, for a young man starting
in life, integrity, diligence, temperance, purity, and thrift
constitute a better capital than any amount of mere
money.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>Yet even of those who appreciate the value of these
qualities and acknowledge the Bible as their source,
there are but few who recognize the principle upon
which they depend.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Stewardship</i></div>

<p class='c014'>That which lies at the foundation of business integrity
and of true success is the recognition of God’s
ownership. The Creator of all things, He is the original
proprietor. We are His stewards. All that we
have is a trust from Him, to be used according to His
direction.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is an obligation that rests upon every human
being. It has to do with the whole sphere of human
activity. Whether we recognize it or not, we are
stewards, supplied from God with talents and facilities,
and placed in the world to do a work appointed by
Him.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>To every man is given “his work,”<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c015'><sup>[191]</sup></a>—the work for
which his capabilities adapt him,—the work which will
result in greatest good to himself and to his fellow-men,
and in greatest honor to God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Be Not Anxious</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>Thus our business or calling is a part of God’s great
plan, and, so long as it is conducted in accordance
with His will, He Himself is responsible for the results.
“Laborers together with God,”<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c015'><sup>[192]</sup></a> our part is faithful compliance
with His directions. Thus there is no place for
anxious care. Diligence, fidelity, care-taking, thrift, and
discretion are called for. Every faculty is to be exercised
to its highest capacity. But the dependence will
be, not on the successful outcome of our efforts, but
on the promise of God. The word that fed Israel in the
desert, and sustained Elijah through the time of famine,
has the same power to-day. “Be not anxious,<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c015'><sup>[193]</sup></a> saying,
What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink?...
Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness;
and all these things shall be added unto you.”<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c015'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tithing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>He who gives men power to get wealth has with the
gift bound up an obligation. Of all that we acquire He
claims a specified portion. The tithe is the Lord’s.
“All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
land or of the fruit of the tree,” “the tithe of the herd
or of the flock,&nbsp;... shall be holy unto the Lord.”<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c015'><sup>[195]</sup></a>
The pledge made by Jacob at Bethel shows the extent
of the obligation. “Of all that Thou shalt give me,”
he said, “I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.”<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c015'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,”<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c015'><sup>[197]</sup></a> is
God’s command. No appeal is made to gratitude or to
generosity. This is a matter of simple honesty. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>tithe is the Lord’s; and He bids us return to Him that
which is His own.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is required in stewards, that a man be found
faithful.”<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c015'><sup>[198]</sup></a> If honesty is an essential principle of business
life, must we not recognize our obligation to
God,—the obligation that underlies every other?</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ministry</i></div>

<p class='c014'>By the terms of our stewardship we are placed under
obligation, not only to God, but to man. To the infinite
love of the Redeemer every human being is indebted for
the gifts of life. Food and raiment and shelter, body
and mind and soul,—all are the purchase of His blood.
And by the obligation of gratitude and service thus
imposed, Christ has bound us to our fellow-men. He
bids us, “By love serve one another.”<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c015'><sup>[199]</sup></a> “Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My
brethren, ye have done it unto Me.”<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c015'><sup>[200]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>I Am Debtor</i>”</div>

and to the barbarians; both to the wise and to the
unwise.”<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c015'><sup>[201]</sup></a> So also are we. By all that has blessed
our life above others, we are placed under obligation
to every human being whom we might benefit.</p>

<p class='c014'>These truths are not for the closet more than for
the counting-room. The goods that we handle are not
our own, and never can this fact safely be lost sight of.
We are but stewards, and on the discharge of our obligation
to God and man depend both the welfare of our
fellow-beings and our own destiny for this life and for
the life to come.</p>

only the brief years of this present life, and makes no
provision for the unending future. Let the youth be
taught to take eternity into their reckoning. Let them
be taught to choose the principles and seek the possessions
that are enduring,—to lay up for themselves that
“treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no
thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth;” to make

but He who reads the heart, who discerns the secret
springs of motive and action, can with absolute truth
delineate character, or give a faithful picture of a human
life. In God’s word alone is found such delineation.</p>

<p class='c014'>No truth does the Bible more clearly teach than that
what we do is the result of what we are. To a great
degree the experiences of life are the fruition of our own
thoughts and deeds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The curse causeless shall not come.”<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c015'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Retribution</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with
him;&nbsp;... unto the wicked, it shall be ill with him;
for the reward of his hands shall be given him.”<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c015'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“Hear, O earth; behold, I will bring evil upon this
people, even the fruit of their thoughts.”<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c015'><sup>[226]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Terrible is this truth, and deeply should it be impressed.
Every deed reacts upon the doer. Never a
human being but may recognize, in the evils that curse
his life, fruitage of his own sowing. Yet even thus we
are not without hope.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Experience of Jacob</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>To gain the birthright that was his already by God’s
promise, Jacob resorted to fraud, and he reaped the
harvest in his brother’s hatred. Through twenty years
of exile he was himself wronged and defrauded, and was
at last forced to find safety in flight; and he reaped a
second harvest, as the evils of his own character were
seen to crop out in his sons;—all but too true a picture
of the retributions of human life.</p>

<p class='c014'>But God says: “I will not contend forever, neither
will I be always wroth; for the spirit should fail before
Me, and the souls which I have made. For the iniquity
of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hid
Me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the
way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal
him; I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto
him and to his mourners.... Peace, peace to
him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the
Lord; and I will heal him.”<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c015'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gain through Loss</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Jacob in his distress was not overwhelmed. He had
repented, he had endeavored to atone for the wrong to
his brother. And when threatened with death through
the wrath of Esau, he sought help from God. “Yea,
he had power over the Angel, and prevailed; he wept,
and made supplication.” “And He blessed him there.”<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c015'><sup>[228]</sup></a>
In the power of His might the forgiven one stood up, no
longer the supplanter, but a prince with God. He had
gained not merely deliverance from his outraged brother,
but deliverance from himself. The power of evil in his
own nature was broken; his character was transformed.</p>

<p class='c014'>At eventide there was light. Jacob, reviewing his
life-history, recognized the sustaining power of God,—“the
God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
the Angel which redeemed me from all evil.”<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c015'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>The same experience is repeated in the history of
Jacob’s sons,—sin working retribution, and repentance
bearing fruit of righteousness unto life.</p>

<p class='c014'>God does not annul His laws. He does not work
contrary to them. The work of sin He does not undo.
But He transforms. Through His grace the curse
works out blessing.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Levites</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Of the sons of Jacob, Levi was one of the most
cruel and vindictive, one of the two most guilty in the
treacherous murder of the Shechemites. Levi’s characteristics,
reflected in his descendants, incurred for them
the decree from God, “I will divide them in Jacob, and
scatter them in Israel.”<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c015'><sup>[230]</sup></a> But repentance wrought re-formation;
and by their faithfulness to God amidst the
apostasy of the other tribes, the curse was transformed
into a token of highest honor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Curse Transformed</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“The Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the
Lord to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name.”
“My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I
gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared Me,
and was afraid before My name.... He walked
with Me in peace and equity, and did turn many away
from iniquity.”<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c015'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The appointed ministers of the sanctuary, the
Levites received no landed inheritance; they dwelt
together in cities set apart for their use, and received
their support from the tithes and the gifts and offerings
devoted to God’s service. They were the teachers of
the people, guests at all their festivities, and everywhere
honored as servants and representatives of God.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>To the whole nation was given the command: “Take
heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as
long as thou livest upon the earth.” “Levi hath no
part nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his
inheritance.”<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c015'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Report of the Spies</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The truth that as a man “thinketh in his heart, so
is he,”<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c015'><sup>[233]</sup></a> finds another illustration in Israel’s experience.
On the borders of Canaan the spies, returned from
searching the country, made their report. The beauty
and fruitfulness of the land were lost sight of, through
fear of the difficulties in the way of its occupation.
The cities walled up to heaven, the giant warriors, the
iron chariots, daunted their faith. Leaving God out of
the question, the multitude echoed the decision of the
unbelieving spies, “We be not able to go up against
the people; for they are stronger than we.”<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c015'><sup>[234]</sup></a> Their
words proved true. They were not able to go up, and
they wore out their lives in the desert.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>By Faith to Conquest</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Two, however, of the twelve who had viewed the
land, reasoned otherwise. “We are well able to overcome
it,”<a href='#f234' class='c015'><sup>[234]</sup></a> they urged, counting God’s promise superior
to giants, walled cities, or chariots of iron. For them
their word was true. Though they shared with their
brethren the forty years’ wandering, Caleb and Joshua
entered the land of promise. As courageous of heart
as when with the hosts of the Lord he set out from
Egypt, Caleb asked for and received as his portion the
stronghold of the giants. In God’s strength he drove
out the Canaanites. The vineyards and olive-groves
where his feet had trodden became his possession.
Though the cowards and rebels perished in the wilderness,
the men of faith ate of the grapes of Eschol.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>One Evil Cherished</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>No truth does the Bible set forth in clearer light
than the peril of even one departure from the right,—peril
both to the wrong-doer and to all whom his
influence shall reach. Example has wonderful power;
and when cast on the side of the evil tendencies of our
nature, it becomes well-nigh irresistible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Decoys of the Tempter</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The strongest bulwark of vice in our world is not
the iniquitous life of the abandoned sinner or the degraded
outcast; it is that life which otherwise appears
virtuous, honorable, and noble, but in which one sin is
fostered, one vice indulged. To the soul that is struggling
in secret against some giant temptation, trembling
upon the very verge of the precipice, such an example
is one of the most powerful enticements to sin. He
who, endowed with high conceptions of life and truth
and honor, does yet wilfully transgress one precept of
God’s holy law, has perverted his noble gifts into a
lure to sin. Genius, talent, sympathy, even generous
and kindly deeds, may thus become decoys of Satan to
entice souls over the precipice of ruin.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is why God has given so many examples
showing the results of even one wrong act. From
the sad story of that one sin which “brought death
into the world, and all our woe, with loss of Eden,” to
the record of him who for thirty pieces of silver sold
the Lord of glory, Bible biography abounds in these
examples, set up as beacons of warning at the byways
leading from the path of life.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>There is warning also in noting the results that have
followed upon even once yielding to human weakness
and error, the fruit of the letting go of faith.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>One Failure of Faith</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Loss to Elijah</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>By one failure of his faith, Elijah cut short his life-work. Heavy was the burden that he had borne in
behalf of Israel; faithful had been his warnings against
the national idolatry; and deep was his solicitude as
during three years and a half of famine he watched
and waited for some token of repentance. Alone he
stood for God upon Mount Carmel. Through the
power of faith, idolatry was cast down, and the blessed
rain testified to the showers of blessing waiting to be
poured upon Israel. Then in his weariness and weakness
he fled before the threats of Jezebel, and alone in
the desert prayed that he might die. His faith had
failed. The work he had begun, he was not to complete.
God bade him anoint another to be prophet in
his stead.</p>

<p class='c014'>But God had marked the heart-service of His servant.
Elijah was not to perish in discouragement and
solitude in the wilderness. Not for him the descent
to the tomb, but the ascent with God’s angels to the
presence of His glory.</p>

<p class='c014'>These life-records declare what every human being
will one day understand,—that sin can bring only shame
and loss; that unbelief means failure; but that God’s
mercy reaches to the deepest depths; that faith lifts up
the repenting soul to share the adoption of the sons
of God.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Discipline</i></div>

<p class='c014'>All who in this world render true service to God
or man receive a preparatory training in the school of
sorrow. The weightier the trust and the higher the
service, the closer is the test and the more severe the
discipline.</p>

<p class='c014'>Study the experiences of Joseph and of Moses, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Daniel and of David. Compare the early history of
David with the history of Solomon, and consider the
results.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>David</i></div>

<p class='c014'>David in his youth was intimately associated with
Saul, and his stay at court and his connection with the
king’s household gave him an insight into the cares and
sorrows and perplexities concealed by the glitter and
pomp of royalty. He saw of how little worth is human
glory to bring peace to the soul. And it was with relief
and gladness that he returned from the king’s court to
the sheepfolds and the flocks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>In Training for the Throne</i></div>

<p class='c014'>When by the jealousy of Saul driven a fugitive into
the wilderness, David, cut off from human support,
leaned more heavily upon God. The uncertainty and
unrest of the wilderness life, its unceasing peril, its
necessity for frequent flight, the character of the men
who gathered to him there,—“every one that was in
distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one
that was discontented,”<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c015'><sup>[235]</sup></a>—all rendered the more essential
a stern self-discipline. These experiences aroused
and developed power to deal with men, sympathy for
the oppressed, and hatred of injustice. Through years
of waiting and peril, David learned to find in God his
comfort, his support, his life. He learned that only
by God’s power could he come to the throne; only in
His wisdom could he rule wisely. It was through the
training in the school of hardship and sorrow that
David was able to make the record—though afterward
marred with his great sin—that he “executed judgment
and justice unto all his people.”<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c015'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Solomon</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The discipline of David’s early experience was lacking
in that of Solomon. In circumstances, in character,
and in life, he seemed favored above all others. Noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>in youth, noble in manhood, the beloved of his God,
Solomon entered on a reign that gave high promise of
prosperity and honor. Nations marveled at the knowledge
and insight of the man to whom God had given
wisdom. But the pride of prosperity brought separation
from God. From the joy of divine communion
Solomon turned to find satisfaction in the pleasures of
sense. Of this experience he says:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Pride of Prosperity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“I made me great works; I builded me houses; I
planted me vineyards; I made me gardens and orchards;&nbsp;... I got me servants and maidens;&nbsp;... I
gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
of kings and of the provinces. I gat me men-singers
and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of
men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. So I
was great, and increased more than all that were before
me in Jerusalem.... And whatsoever mine eyes
desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart
from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor....
Then I looked on all the works that my hands
had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to
do; and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit,
and there was no profit under the sun. And I turned
myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for
what can the man do that cometh after the king?
even that which hath been already done.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Unsatisfied</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“I hated life.... Yea, I hated all my labor
which I had taken under the sun.”<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c015'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>By his own bitter experience, Solomon learned the
emptiness of a life that seeks in earthly things its highest
good. He erected altars to heathen gods, only to learn
how vain is their promise of rest to the soul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Late Return</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In his later years, turning wearied and thirsting from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>earth’s broken cisterns, Solomon returned to drink at
the fountain of life. The history of his wasted years,
with their lessons of warning, he by the Spirit of inspiration
recorded for after-generations. And thus, although
the seed of his sowing was reaped by his people in
harvests of evil, the life-work of Solomon was not
wholly lost. For him at last the discipline of suffering
accomplished its work.</p>

<p class='c014'>But with such a dawning, how glorious might have
been his life’s day, had Solomon in his youth learned
the lesson that suffering had taught in other lives!</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>God’s Witnesses</i></div>

<p class='c014'>For those who love God, those who are “the called
according to his purpose,”<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c015'><sup>[238]</sup></a> Bible biography has a yet
higher lesson of the ministry of sorrow. “Ye are My
witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God,”<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c015'><sup>[239]</sup></a>—witnesses
that He is good, and that goodness is supreme. “We

<div class='sidenote'><i>Accusation from Satan</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Unselfishness, the principle of God’s kingdom, is the
principle that Satan hates; its very existence he denies.
From the beginning of the great controversy he has
endeavored to prove God’s principles of action to be
selfish, and he deals in the same way with all who serve
God. To disprove Satan’s claim is the work of Christ
and of all who bear His name.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was to give in His own life an illustration of
unselfishness that Jesus came in the form of humanity.
And all who accept this principle are to be workers
together with Him in demonstrating it in practical life.
To choose the right because it is right; to stand for
truth at the cost of suffering and sacrifice,—“this is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness
is of Me, saith the Lord.”<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c015'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Testing of Job</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Very early in the history of the world is given the
life-record of one over whom this controversy of Satan’s
was waged.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of Job, the patriarch of Uz, the testimony of the
Searcher of hearts was, “There is none like him in the
earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth
God, and escheweth evil.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Against this man, Satan brought scornful charge:
“Doth Job fear God for naught? Hast Thou not made
a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all
that he hath on every side?... Put forth Thine
hand now, and touch all that he hath;” “touch his
bone and his flesh, and he will curse Thee to Thy face.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Lord said unto Satan, “All that he hath is in
thy power.” “Behold, he is in thine hand; but save
his life.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus permitted, Satan swept away all that Job possessed,—flocks
and herds, men-servants and maidens,
sons and daughters; and he “smote Job with sore boils
from the sole of his foot unto his crown.”<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c015'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Misconception of Adversity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Still another element of bitterness was added to his
cup. His friends, seeing in adversity but the retribution
of sin, pressed on his bruised and burdened spirit their
accusations of wrong-doing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Seemingly forsaken of heaven and earth, yet holding
fast his faith in God and his consciousness of integrity,
in anguish and perplexity he cried:—</p>

<p class='c014'>On the record of those who through self-abnegation
have entered into the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>stand—one in the Old Testament and one in the New—the
names of Jonathan and of John the Baptist.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Faithful Friend</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Jonathan, by birth heir to the throne, yet knowing
himself set aside by the divine decree; to his rival the
most tender and faithful of friends, shielding David’s
life at the peril of his own; steadfast at his father’s side
through the dark days of his declining power, and at
his side falling at the last,—the name of Jonathan is
treasured in heaven, and it stands on earth a witness
to the existence and the power of unselfish love.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Unwavering Witness</i></div>

<p class='c014'>John the Baptist, at his appearance as the Messiah’s
herald, stirred the nation. From place to place his steps
were followed by vast throngs of people of every rank
and station. But when the One came to whom he had
borne witness, all was changed. The crowds followed
Jesus, and John’s work seemed fast closing. Yet there
was no wavering of his faith. “He must increase,” he
said, “but I must decrease.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c015'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Time passed, and the kingdom which John had
confidently expected was not established. In Herod’s
dungeon, cut off from the life-giving air and the desert
freedom, he waited and watched.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no display of arms, no rending of prison
doors; but the healing of the sick, the preaching of the
gospel, the uplifting of men’s souls, testified to Christ’s
mission.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Fellowship in Sacrifice</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Alone in the dungeon, seeing whither his path, like
his Master’s, tended, John accepted the trust,—fellowship
with Christ in sacrifice. Heaven’s messengers
attended him to the grave. The intelligences of the
universe, fallen and unfallen, witnessed his vindication
of unselfish service.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>There Hath Not Risen a Greater</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>And in all the generations that have passed since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>then, suffering souls have been sustained by the testimony
of John’s life. In the dungeon, on the scaffold,
in the flames, men and women through centuries of

feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and

gathered themselves together, to ask help of the Lord;
even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the
Lord.” And Jehoshaphat, standing in the temple-court
before his people, poured out his soul in prayer, pleading
God’s promise, with confession of Israel’s helplessness.
“We have no might against this great company
that cometh against us,” he said; “neither know we

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>The history of the songs of the Bible is full of
suggestion as to the uses and benefits of music and
song. Music is often perverted to serve purposes of
evil, and it thus becomes one of the most alluring
agencies of temptation. But, rightly employed, it is a
precious gift of God, designed to uplift the thoughts to
high and noble themes, to inspire and elevate the soul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Power of Song</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As the children of Israel, journeying through the
wilderness, cheered their way by the music of sacred
song, so God bids His children to-day gladden their
pilgrim life. There are few means more effective for
fixing His words in the memory than repeating them
in song. And such song has wonderful power. It has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>power to subdue rude and uncultivated natures; power
to quicken thought and to awaken sympathy, to promote
harmony of action, and to banish the gloom and
foreboding that destroy courage and weaken effort.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Means of Education</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is one of the most effective means of impressing
the heart with spiritual truth. How often to the soul
hard-pressed and ready to despair, memory recalls some
word of God’s,—the long-forgotten burden of a childhood
song,—and temptations lose their power, life takes
on new meaning and new purpose, and courage and
gladness are imparted to other souls!</p>

<p class='c014'>The value of song as a means of education should
never be lost sight of. Let there be singing in the
home, of songs that are sweet and pure, and there will
be fewer words of censure, and more of cheerfulness and
hope and joy. Let there be singing in the school, and
the pupils will be drawn closer to God, to their teachers,
and to one another.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a part of religious service, singing is as much an
act of worship as is prayer. Indeed, many a song is
prayer. If the child is taught to realize this, he will
think more of the meaning of the words he sings, and
will be more susceptible to their power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Angels’ Song</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As our Redeemer leads us to the threshold of the
Infinite, flushed with the glory of God, we may catch
the themes of praise and thanksgiving from the heavenly
choir round about the throne; and as the echo of the
angels’ song is awakened in our earthly homes, hearts
will be drawn closer to the heavenly singers. Heaven’s
communion begins on earth. We learn here the keynote
of its praise.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='small'>“CANST THOU BY SEARCHING</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>FIND OUT GOD?”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Canst Thou Find Out God?</i>”</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>No finite mind can fully comprehend the character
or the works of the Infinite One. We can not by
searching find out God. To minds the strongest and
most highly cultured, as well as to the weakest and
most ignorant, that holy Being must remain clothed in
mystery. But though “clouds and darkness are round
about Him, righteousness and judgment are the foundation
of His throne.”<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c015'><sup>[273]</sup></a> We can so far comprehend His
dealing with us as to discern boundless mercy united
to infinite power. We can understand as much of His
purposes as we are capable of comprehending; beyond
this we may still trust the hand that is omnipotent, the
heart that is full of love.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ground for Trust</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The word of God, like the character of its Author,
presents mysteries that can never be fully comprehended
by finite beings. But God has given in the Scriptures
sufficient evidence of their divine authority. His own
existence, His character, the truthfulness of His word,
are established by testimony that appeals to our reason;
and this testimony is abundant. True, He has not
removed the possibility of doubt; faith must rest upon
evidence, not demonstration; those who wish to doubt
have opportunity; but those who desire to know the
truth find ample ground for faith.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>We have no reason to doubt God’s word because
we can not understand the mysteries of His providence.
In the natural world we are constantly surrounded with
wonders beyond our comprehension. Should we then
be surprised to find in the spiritual world also mysteries
that we can not fathom? The difficulty lies solely in
the weakness and narrowness of the human mind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mysteries Evidence of Divinity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The mysteries of the Bible, so far from being an
argument against it, are among the strongest evidences
of its divine inspiration. If it contained no account of
God but that which we could comprehend; if His
greatness and majesty could be grasped by finite minds,
then the Bible would not, as now, bear the unmistakable
evidences of divinity. The greatness of its themes
should inspire faith in it as the word of God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Simplicity and Adaptation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Bible unfolds truth with a simplicity and an
adaptation to the needs and longings of the human
heart that has astonished and charmed the most highly
cultivated minds, while to the humble and uncultured
also it makes plain the way of life. “The wayfaring
men, though fools, shall not err therein.”<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c015'><sup>[274]</sup></a> No child
need mistake the path. Not one trembling seeker need
fail of walking in pure and holy light. Yet the most
simply stated truths lay hold upon themes elevated,
far-reaching, infinitely beyond the power of human comprehension,—mysteries
that are the hiding of His glory,—mysteries
that overpower the mind in its research,
while they inspire the sincere seeker for truth with
reverence and faith. The more we search the Bible,
the deeper is our conviction that it is the word of the
living God, and human reason bows before the majesty
of divine revelation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Limit to Comprehension</i></div>

<p class='c014'>God intends that to the earnest seeker the truths of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>His word shall be ever unfolding. While “the secret
things belong unto the Lord our God,” “those things
which are revealed belong unto us and to our children.”<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c015'><sup>[275]</sup></a>
The idea that certain portions of the Bible can
not be understood has led to neglect of some of its
most important truths. The fact needs to be emphasized,
and often repeated, that the mysteries of the Bible
are not such because God has sought to conceal truth,
but because our own weakness or ignorance makes us
incapable of comprehending or appropriating truth. The
limitation is not in His purpose, but in our capacity.
Of those very portions of Scripture often passed by as
impossible to be understood, God desires us to understand
as much as our minds are capable of receiving.
“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,” that we
may be “thoroughly furnished unto all good works.”<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c015'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Inexhaustible Riches</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is impossible for any human mind to exhaust even
one truth or promise of the Bible. One catches the
glory from one point of view, another from another
point; yet we can discern only gleamings. The full
radiance is beyond our vision.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we contemplate the great things of God’s word,
we look into a fountain that broadens and deepens
beneath our gaze. Its breadth and depth pass our
knowledge. As we gaze, the vision widens; stretched
out before us we behold a boundless, shoreless sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such study has vivifying power. The mind and
heart acquire new strength, new life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tested by Experience</i></div>

<p class='c014'>This experience is the highest evidence of the divine
authorship of the Bible. We receive God’s word as food
for the soul, through the same evidence by which we
receive bread as food for the body. Bread supplies the
need of our nature; we know by experience that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>produces blood and bone and brain. Apply the same
test to the Bible: when its principles have actually
become the elements of character, what has been the
result? what changes have been made in the life?—“Old
things are passed away; behold, all things are become
new.”<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c015'><sup>[277]</sup></a> In its power, men and women have broken the
chains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness.
The profane have become reverent, the drunken
sober, the profligate pure. Souls that have borne the
likeness of Satan, have been transformed into the image
of God. This change is itself the miracle of miracles.
A change wrought by the word, it is one of the deepest
mysteries of the word. We can not understand it; we
can only believe, as declared by the Scriptures, it is
“Christ in you, the hope of glory.”<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c015'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>A knowledge of this mystery furnishes a key to
every other. It opens to the soul the treasures of
the universe, the possibilities of infinite development.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pledge of Eternal Growth</i></div>

<p class='c014'>And this development is gained through the constant
unfolding to us of the character of God,—the
glory and the mystery of the written word. If it
were possible for us to attain to a full understanding
of God and His word, there would be for us no
further discovery of truth, no greater knowledge, no
further development. God would cease to be supreme,
and man would cease to advance. Thank God, it is
not so. Since God is infinite, and in Him are all the
treasures of wisdom, we may to all eternity be ever
searching, ever learning, yet never exhaust the riches
of His wisdom, His goodness, or His power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Earliest of Annals</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The Bible is the most ancient and the most comprehensive
history that men possess. It came fresh
from the fountain of eternal truth, and throughout the
ages a divine hand has preserved its purity. It lights
up the far-distant past, where human research in vain
seeks to penetrate. In God’s word only do we behold
the power that laid the foundations of the earth, and
that stretched out the heavens. Here only do we find
an authentic account of the origin of nations. Here
only is given a history of our race unsullied by human
pride or prejudice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Philosophy of History</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the annals of human history the growth of
nations, the rise and fall of empires, appear as dependent
on the will and prowess of man. The shaping of
events seems, to a great degree, to be determined by
his power, ambition, or caprice. But in the word of
God the curtain is drawn aside, and we behold, behind,
above, and through all the play and counter-play of
human interests and power and passions, the agencies
of the all-merciful One, silently, patiently working out
the counsels of His own will.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Distribution of Races</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Bible reveals the true philosophy of history.
In those words of matchless beauty and tenderness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>spoken by the apostle Paul to the sages of Athens is
set forth God’s purpose in the creation and distribution
of races and nations: He “hath made of one blood all
nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth,
and hath determined the times before appointed and
the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek
the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find
Him.”<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c015'><sup>[279]</sup></a> God declares that whosoever will may come
“into the bond of the covenant.”<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c015'><sup>[280]</sup></a> In the creation it
was His purpose that the earth be inhabited by beings
whose existence should be a blessing to themselves and
to one another, and an honor to their Creator. All
who will may identify themselves with this purpose.
Of them it is spoken, “This people have I formed for
Myself; they shall show forth My praise.”<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c015'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>God has revealed in His law the principles that
underlie all true prosperity both of nations and of
individuals. “This is your wisdom and your understanding,”
Moses declared to the Israelites of the law
of God. “It is not a vain thing for you; because it is
your life.”<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c015'><sup>[282]</sup></a> The blessings thus assured to Israel are,
on the same conditions and in the same degree, assured
to every nation and every individual under the broad
heavens.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>National Prosperity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The power exercised by every ruler on the earth is
Heaven-imparted; and upon his use of the power thus
bestowed, his success depends. To each the word of
the divine Watcher is, “I girded thee, though thou hast
not known Me.”<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c015'><sup>[283]</sup></a> And to each the words spoken to
Nebuchadnezzar of old are the lesson of life: “Break
off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by
showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening
of thy tranquillity.”<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c015'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Source of Power</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>To understand these things,—to understand that
“righteousness exalteth a nation;” that “the throne
is established by righteousness,” and “upholden by
mercy;”<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c015'><sup>[285]</sup></a> to recognize the outworking of these principles
in the manifestation of His power who “removeth
kings, and setteth up kings,”<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c015'><sup>[286]</sup></a> —this is to understand the
philosophy of history.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the word of God only is this clearly set forth.
Here it is shown that the strength of nations, as of
individuals, is not found in the opportunities or facilities
that appear to make them invincible; it is not found in
their boasted greatness. It is measured by the fidelity
with which they fulfil God’s purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Object of Government</i></div>

<p class='c014'>An illustration of this truth is found in the history
of ancient Babylon. To Nebuchadnezzar the king the
true object of national government was represented
under the figure of a great tree, whose height “reached
unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the
earth; the leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof
much, and in it was meat for all;” under its shadow
the beasts of the field dwelt, and among its branches
the birds of the air had their habitation.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c015'><sup>[287]</sup></a> This representation
shows the character of a government that
fulfils God’s purpose,—a government that protects and
upbuilds the nation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Babylon the Great</i></div>

<p class='c014'>God exalted Babylon that it might fulfil this purpose.
Prosperity attended the nation, until it reached
a height of wealth and power that has never since
been equaled,—fitly represented in the Scriptures by
the inspired symbol, a “head of gold.”<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c015'><sup>[288]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>But the king failed of recognizing the power that
had exalted him. Nebuchadnezzar in the pride of his
heart said: “Is not this great Babylon, that I have built
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>for the house of the kingdom by the might of my
power, and for the honor of my majesty?”<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c015'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Its Oppressive Power</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Instead of being a protector of men, Babylon became
a proud and cruel oppressor. The words of
Inspiration picturing the cruelty and greed of rulers
in Israel, reveal the secret of Babylon’s fall, and of the
fall of many another kingdom since the world began:
“Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye
kill them that are fed; but ye feed not the flock. The
diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye
healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound
up that which was broken, neither have ye brought
again that which was driven away, neither have ye
sought that which was lost; but with force and with
cruelty have ye ruled them.”<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c015'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Retribution</i></div>

<p class='c014'>To the ruler of Babylon came the sentence of the
divine Watcher: O king, “to thee it is spoken: The
kingdom is departed from thee.”<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c015'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rise and Fall of Nations</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Every nation that has come upon the stage of action
has been permitted to occupy its place on the earth, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>it might be seen whether it would fulfil the purpose of
“the Watcher and the Holy One.” Prophecy has
traced the rise and fall of the world’s great empires,—Babylon,
Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. With each
of these, as with nations of less power, history repeated
itself. Each had its period of test, each failed, its glory
faded, its power departed, and its place was occupied by
another.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the nations rejected God’s principles, and in
this rejection wrought their own ruin, it was still manifest
that the divine, overruling purpose was working
through all their movements.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vision of the Cherubim</i></div>

<p class='c014'>This lesson is taught in a wonderful symbolic representation
given to the prophet Ezekiel during his exile
in the land of the Chaldeans. The vision was given at
a time when Ezekiel was weighed down with sorrowful
memories and troubled forebodings. The land of his
fathers was desolate. Jerusalem was depopulated. The
prophet himself was a stranger in a land where ambition
and cruelty reigned supreme. As on every hand he
beheld tyranny and wrong, his soul was distressed, and
he mourned day and night. But the symbols presented
to him revealed a power above that of earthly rulers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Guiding Hand</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Upon the banks of the river Chebar, Ezekiel beheld
a whirlwind seeming to come from the north, “a great
cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was
about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of
amber.” A number of wheels, intersecting one another,
were moved by four living beings. High above all
these was the “likeness of a throne, as the appearance
of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne
was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon
it.” “And there appeared in the cherubim the form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>a man’s hand under their wings.”<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c015'><sup>[294]</sup></a> The wheels were
so complicated in arrangement that at first sight they
appeared to be in confusion; but they moved in perfect
harmony. Heavenly beings, sustained and guided
by the hand beneath the wings of the cherubim, were
impelling these wheels; above them, upon the sapphire
throne, was the Eternal One; and round about the
throne a rainbow, the emblem of divine mercy.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the wheel-like complications were under the
guidance of the hand beneath the wings of the cherubim,
so the complicated play of human events is under
divine control. Amidst the strife and tumult of nations,
He that sitteth above the cherubim still guides the
affairs of the earth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Place in God’s Purpose</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The history of nations that one after another have
occupied their allotted time and place, unconsciously
witnessing to the truth of which they themselves knew
not the meaning, speaks to us. To every nation and to
every individual of to-day God has assigned a place in
His great plan. To-day men and nations are being
measured by the plummet in the hand of Him who
makes no mistake. All are by their own choice
deciding their destiny, and God is overruling all for
the accomplishment of His purposes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Fulfilment of Prophecy</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The history which the great I AM has marked out
in His word, uniting link after link in the prophetic
chain, from eternity in the past to eternity in the future,
tells us where we are to-day in the procession of the
ages, and what may be expected in the time to come.
All that prophecy has foretold as coming to pass, until
the present time, has been traced on the pages of
history, and we may be assured that all which is yet
to come will be fulfilled in its order.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>The final overthrow of all earthly dominions is
plainly foretold in the word of truth. In the prophecy
uttered when sentence from God was pronounced upon
the last king of Israel is given the message:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thus saith the Lord God: Remove the diadem,
and take off the crown;&nbsp;... exalt him that is low,
and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn,
overturn it; and it shall be no more, until He come
whose right it is; and I will give it Him.”<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c015'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The crown removed from Israel passed successively
to the kingdoms of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and
Rome. God says, “It shall be no more, until He
come whose right it is; and I will give it Him.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Signs of the Times</i></div>

<p class='c014'>That time is at hand. To-day the signs of the
times declare that we are standing on the threshold of
great and solemn events. Everything in our world is
in agitation. Before our eyes is fulfilling the Saviour’s
prophecy of the events to precede His coming: “Ye
shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.... Nation
shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes,
in divers places.”<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c015'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>On the Verge of a Crisis</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The present is a time of overwhelming interest to all
living. Rulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions
of trust and authority, thinking men and women
of all classes, have their attention fixed upon the events
taking place about us. They are watching the strained,
restless relations that exist among the nations. They
observe the intensity that is taking possession of every
earthly element, and they recognize that something great
and decisive is about to take place,—that the world is
on the verge of a stupendous crisis.</p>

<p class='c014'>Angels are now restraining the winds of strife, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>they may not blow until the world shall be warned of
its coming doom; but a storm is gathering, ready to
burst upon the earth; and when God shall bid His
angels loose the winds, there will be such a scene of
strife as no pen can picture.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Final Scenes</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Bible, and the Bible only, gives a correct view
of these things. Here are revealed the great final
scenes in the history of our world, events that already
are casting their shadows before, the sound of their
approach causing the earth to tremble, and men’s
hearts to fail them for fear.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and
maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattered
abroad the inhabitants thereof;&nbsp;... because
they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance,
broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the
curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein
are desolate.... The mirth of tabrets ceaseth,

the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken
down; for the corn is withered. How do the beasts
groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they
have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made
desolate.” “The vine is dried up, and the fig-tree
languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also,

upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is

<p class='c014'>“I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form,

beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all

<div class='sidenote'><i>Study of Prophecy</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The prophets to whom these great scenes were
revealed longed to understand their import. They
“inquired and searched diligently;&nbsp;... searching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
which was in them did signify.... Unto whom
it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us
they did minister the things which are now reported
unto you;&nbsp;... which things the angels desire to
look into.”<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c015'><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>To us who are standing on the very verge of their
fulfilment, of what deep moment, what living interest,
are these delineations of the things to come,—events for
which, since our first parents turned their steps from
Eden, God’s children have watched and waited, longed
and prayed!</p>

<p class='c014'>At this time, before the great final crisis, as before
the world’s first destruction, men are absorbed in the
pleasures and the pursuits of sense. Engrossed with
the seen and transitory, they have lost sight of the
unseen and eternal. For the things that perish with
the using, they are sacrificing imperishable riches.
Their minds need to be uplifted, their views of life
to be broadened. They need to be aroused from the
lethargy of worldly dreaming.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Lesson for To-Day</i></div>

<p class='c014'>From the rise and fall of nations as made plain in
the pages of Holy Writ, they need to learn how worthless
is mere outward and worldly glory. Babylon, with
all its power and its magnificence, the like of which our
world has never since beheld,—power and magnificence
which to the people of that day seemed so stable and
enduring,—how completely has it passed away! As
“the flower of the grass,” it has perished. So perishes
all that has not God for its foundation. Only that
which is bound up with His purpose, and expresses
His character, can endure. His principles are the only
steadfast things our world knows.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>It is these great truths that old and young need to
learn. We need to study the working out of God’s
purpose in the history of nations and in the revelation
of things to come, that we may estimate at their true
value things seen and things unseen; that we may
learn what is the true aim of life; that, viewing the
things of time in the light of eternity, we may put
them to their truest and noblest use. Thus, learning
here the principles of His kingdom and becoming its
subjects and citizens, we may be prepared at His coming
to enter with Him into its possession.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The End Is at Hand</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The day is at hand. For the lessons to be learned,
the work to be done, the transformation of character to
be effected, the time remaining is but too brief a span.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision
that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth
of the times that are far off. Therefore say unto
them, Thus saith the Lord God: There shall none of
My words be prolonged any more, but the word which
I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord God.”<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c015'><sup>[310]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Bible Student</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>In childhood, youth, and manhood, Jesus studied the
Scriptures. As a little child, He was daily, at His
mother’s knee, taught from the scrolls of the prophets.
In His youth the early morning and the evening twilight
often found Him alone on the mountainside or
among the trees of the forest, spending a quiet hour
in prayer and the study of God’s word. During His
ministry His intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures
testifies to His diligence in their study. And since He
gained knowledge as we may gain it, His wonderful
power, both mental and spiritual, is a testimony to the
value of the Bible as a means of education.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Stories for the Little Ones</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Our heavenly Father, in giving His word, did not
overlook the children. In all that men have written,
where can be found anything that has such a hold
upon the heart, anything so well adapted to awaken the
interest of the little ones, as the stories of the Bible?</p>

<p class='c014'>In these simple stories may be made plain the great
principles of the law of God. Thus by illustrations
best suited to the child’s comprehension, parents and
teachers may begin very early to fulfil the Lord’s
injunction concerning His precepts: “Thou shalt teach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of
them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou
walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and
when thou risest up.”<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c015'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Object Lessons</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The use of object-lessons, blackboards, maps, and
pictures, will be an aid in explaining these lessons,
and fixing them in the memory. Parents and teachers
should constantly seek for improved methods. The
teaching of the Bible should have our freshest thought,
our best methods, and our most earnest effort.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Family Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In arousing and strengthening a love for Bible
study, much depends on the use of the hour of worship.
The hours of morning and evening worship
should be the sweetest and most helpful of the day.
Let it be understood that into these hours no troubled,
unkind thoughts are to intrude; that parents and children
assemble to meet with Jesus, and to invite into
the home the presence of holy angels. Let the services
be brief and full of life, adapted to the occasion,
and varied from time to time. Let all join in the Bible
reading, and learn and often repeat God’s law. It will
add to the interest of the children if they are sometimes
permitted to select the reading. Question them
upon it, and let them ask questions. Mention anything
that will serve to illustrate its meaning. When the
service is not thus made too lengthy, let the little ones
take part in prayer, and let them join in song, if it be
but a single verse.</p>

<p class='c014'>To make such a service what it should be, thought
should be given to preparation. And parents should
take time daily for Bible study with their children. No
doubt it will require effort and planning and some sacrifice
to accomplish this; but the effort will be richly repaid.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Personal Influence and Example</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>As a preparation for teaching His precepts, God
commands that they be hidden in the hearts of the
parents. “These words, which I command thee this
day, shall be in thine heart,” He says; “and thou shalt
teach them diligently.”<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c015'><sup>[312]</sup></a> In order to interest our children
in the Bible, we ourselves must be interested in it.
To awaken in them a love for its study, we must love
it. Our instruction to them will have only the weight
of influence given it by our own example and spirit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Abraham an Illustration</i></div>

<p class='c014'>God called Abraham to be a teacher of His word,
He chose him to be the father of a great nation, because
He saw that Abraham would instruct his children and
his household in the principles of God’s law. And that
which gave power to Abraham’s teaching was the influence
of his own life. His great household consisted
of more than a thousand souls, many of them heads
of families, and not a few but newly converted from
heathenism. Such a household required a firm hand
at the helm. No weak, vacillating methods would
suffice. Of Abraham God said, “I know him, that he
will command his children and his household after
him.”<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c015'><sup>[313]</sup></a> Yet his authority was exercised with such
wisdom and tenderness that hearts were won. The
testimony of the divine Watcher is, “They shall keep
the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.”<a href='#f313' class='c015'><sup>[313]</sup></a>
And Abraham’s influence extended beyond his own
household. Wherever he pitched his tent, he set up
beside it the altar for sacrifice and worship. When
the tent was removed, the altar remained; and many a
roving Canaanite, whose knowledge of God had been
gained from the life of Abraham His servant, tarried
at that altar to offer sacrifice to Jehovah.</p>

<p class='c014'>No less effective to-day will be the teaching of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>God’s word when it finds as faithful a reflection in the
teacher’s life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Original Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is not enough to know what others have thought
or learned about the Bible. Every one must in the
judgment give account of himself to God, and each
should now learn for himself what is truth. But in
order to effective study, the interest of the pupil must
be enlisted. Especially by the one who has to deal
with children and youth differing widely in disposition,
training, and habits of thought, this is a matter not
to be lost sight of. In teaching children the Bible, we
may gain much by observing the bent of their minds,
the things in which they are interested, and arousing
their interest to see what the Bible says about these
things. He who created us, with our various aptitudes,
has in His word given something for every one. As
the pupils see that the lessons of the Bible apply to
their own lives, teach them to look to it as a counselor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Beauty of Thought and Expression</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Help them also to appreciate its wonderful beauty.
Many books of no real value, books that are exciting
and unhealthful, are recommended, or at least permitted
to be used, because of their supposed literary
value. Why should we direct our children to drink of
these polluted streams, when they may have free access
to the pure fountains of the word of God? The Bible
has a fulness, a strength, a depth of meaning, that is inexhaustible.
Encourage the children and youth to seek
out its treasures, both of thought and of expression.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the beauty of these precious things attracts their
minds, a softening, subduing power will touch their
hearts. They will be drawn to Him who has thus
revealed Himself to them. And there are few who
will not desire to know more of His works and ways.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Purpose in Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>The student of the Bible should be taught to
approach it in the spirit of a learner. We are to search
its pages, not for proof to sustain our opinions, but in
order to know what God says.</p>

<p class='c014'>A true knowledge of the Bible can be gained only
through the aid of that Spirit by whom the word was
given. And in order to gain this knowledge we must
live by it. All that God’s word commands, we are to
obey. All that it promises, we may claim. The life
which it enjoins is the life that, through its power, we
are to live. Only as the Bible is thus held can it be
studied effectively.</p>

<p class='c014'>The study of the Bible demands our most diligent
effort and persevering thought. As the miner digs for
the golden treasure in the earth, so earnestly, persistently,
must we seek for the treasure of God’s word.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Thoroughness and Concentration</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In daily study the verse-by-verse method is often
most helpful. Let the student take one verse, and concentrate
the mind on ascertaining the thought that God
has put into that verse for him, and then dwell upon
the thought until it becomes his own. One passage
thus studied until its significance is clear, is of more
value than the perusal of many chapters with no definite
purpose in view, and no positive instruction gained.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Unwholesome Literature</i></div>

<p class='c014'>One of the chief causes of mental inefficiency and
moral weakness is the lack of concentration for worthy
ends. We pride ourselves on the wide distribution of
literature; but the multiplication of books, even books
that in themselves are not harmful, may be a positive
evil. With the immense tide of printed matter constantly
pouring from the press, old and young form the
habit of reading hastily and superficially, and the mind
loses its power of connected and vigorous thought.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Furthermore, a large share of the periodicals and books
that, like the frogs of Egypt, are overspreading the land,
are not merely commonplace, idle, and enervating, but
unclean and degrading. Their effect is not merely to
intoxicate and ruin the mind, but to corrupt and destroy
the soul. The mind, the heart, that is indolent, aimless,
falls an easy prey to evil. It is on diseased, lifeless
organisms that fungus roots. It is the idle mind that
is Satan’s workshop. Let the mind be directed to
high and holy ideals, let the life have a noble aim,
an absorbing purpose, and evil finds little foothold.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Shield from Temptation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Let the youth, then, be taught to give close study to
the word of God. Received into the soul, it will prove
a mighty barricade against temptation. “Thy word,”
the psalmist declares, “have I hid in mine heart, that I
might not sin against Thee.” “By the word of Thy
lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.”<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c015'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Comprehensive Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Bible is its own expositor. Scripture is to be
compared with scripture. The student should learn
to view the word as a whole, and to see the relation
of its parts. He should gain a knowledge of its grand
central theme, of God’s original purpose for the world,
of the rise of the great controversy, and of the work of
redemption. He should understand the nature of the
two principles that are contending for supremacy, and
should learn to trace their working through the records
of history and prophecy, to the great consummation.
He should see how this controversy enters into every
phase of human experience; how in every act of life
he himself reveals the one or the other of the two
antagonistic motives; and how, whether he will or not,
he is even now deciding upon which side of the controversy
he will be found.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Every part of the Bible is given by inspiration of
God, and is profitable. The Old Testament no less
than the New should receive attention. As we study
the Old Testament, we shall find living springs bubbling
up where the careless reader discerns only a desert.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Daniel and the Revelation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The book of Revelation, in connection with the
book of Daniel, especially demands study. Let every
God-fearing teacher consider how most clearly to comprehend
and to present the gospel that our Saviour
came in person to make known to His servant John,—“The
Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto
Him, to show unto His servants things which must
shortly come to pass.”<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c015'><sup>[315]</sup></a> None should become discouraged
in the study of the Revelation because of its
apparently mystical symbols. “If any of you lack wisdom,
let him ask of God, that giveth to all liberally, and
upbraideth not.”<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c015'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the
words of this prophecy, and keep those things which
are written therein; for the time is at hand.”<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c015'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Continuous Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'>When a real love for the Bible is awakened, and
the student begins to realize how vast is the field and
how precious its treasure, he will desire to seize upon
every opportunity for acquainting himself with God’s
word. Its study will be restricted to no special time
or place. And this continuous study is one of the best
means of cultivating a love for the Scriptures. Let the
student keep his Bible always with him. As you have
opportunity, read a text and meditate upon it. While
walking the streets, waiting at a railway station, waiting
to meet an engagement, improve the opportunity to
gain some precious thought from the treasure-house of
truth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Results of Study</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>The great motive powers of the soul are faith, hope,
and love; and it is to these that Bible study, rightly
pursued, appeals. The outward beauty of the Bible,
the beauty of imagery and expression, is but the setting,
as it were, for its real treasure,—the beauty of
holiness. In its record of the men who walked with
God, we may catch glimpses of His glory. In the One
“altogether lovely” we behold Him, of whom all beauty
of earth and heaven is but a dim reflection. “I, if I
be lifted up,” He said, “will draw all men unto Me.”<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c015'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
As the student of the Bible beholds the Redeemer,
there is awakened in the soul the mysterious power of
faith, adoration, and love. Upon the vision of Christ the
gaze is fixed, and the beholder grows into the likeness
of that which he adores. The words of the apostle
Paul become the language of the soul: “I count all
things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge
of Christ Jesus my Lord;&nbsp;... that I may know
Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship
of His sufferings.”<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c015'><sup>[319]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Streams of Blessing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The springs of heavenly peace and joy unsealed in
the soul by the words of Inspiration will become a
mighty river of influence to bless all who come within
its reach. Let the youth of to-day, the youth who are
growing up with the Bible in their hands, become the
recipients and the channels of its life-giving energy, and
what streams of blessing would flow forth to the world!—influences
of whose power to heal and comfort we
can scarcely conceive,—rivers of living water fountains
“springing up unto everlasting life.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Importance of Physical Culture</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Since the mind and the soul find expression through
the body, both mental and spiritual vigor are in
great degree dependent upon physical strength and
activity; whatever promotes physical health, promotes
the development of a strong mind and a well-balanced
character. Without health, no one can as distinctly
understand or as completely fulfil his obligations to
himself, to his fellow-beings, or to his Creator. Therefore
the health should be as faithfully guarded as the
character. A knowledge of physiology and hygiene
should be the basis of all educational effort.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Disregard of Principles</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Though the facts of physiology are now so generally
understood, there is an alarming indifference in
regard to the principles of health. Even of those who
have a knowledge of these principles, there are few who
put them in practise. Inclination or impulse is followed
as blindly as if life were controlled by mere chance
rather than by definite and unvarying laws.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Cause of Failure</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The youth, in the freshness and vigor of life, little
realize the value of their abounding energy. A treasure
more precious than gold, more essential to advancement
than learning or rank or riches,—how lightly it is held!
how rashly squandered! How many a man, sacrificing
health in the struggle for riches or power, has almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>reached the object of his desire, only to fall helpless,
while another, possessing superior physical endurance,
grasped the longed for prize! Through morbid conditions,
the result of neglecting the laws of health, how
many have been led into evil practises, to the sacrifice of
every hope for this world and the next!</p>

<p class='c014'>In the study of physiology, pupils should be led to
see the value of physical energy, and how it can be so
preserved and developed as to contribute in the highest
degree to success in life’s great struggle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Teaching Physiology</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Children should be early taught, in simple, easy
lessons, the rudiments of physiology and hygiene. The
work should be begun by the mother in the home,
and should be faithfully carried forward in the school.
As the pupils advance in years, instruction in this line
should be continued, until they are qualified to care for
the house they live in. They should understand the
importance of guarding against disease by preserving
the vigor of every organ, and should also be taught
how to deal with common diseases and accidents.
Every school should give instruction in both physiology
and hygiene, and, so far as possible, should be
provided with facilities for illustrating the structure, use,
and care of the body.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nature’s Laws Divine</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There are matters not usually included in the study
of physiology that should be considered,—matters of
far greater value to the student than are many of the
technicalities commonly taught under this head. As
the foundation principle of all education in these lines,
the youth should be taught that the laws of nature are
the laws of God,—as truly divine as are the precepts
of the decalogue. The laws that govern our physical
organism, God has written upon every nerve, muscle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>and fiber of the body. Every careless or wilful violation
of these laws is a sin against our Creator.</p>

<p class='c014'>How necessary, then, that a thorough knowledge
of these laws should be imparted! The principles of
hygiene as applied to diet, exercise, the care of children,
the treatment of the sick, and many like matters,
should be given much more attention than they ordinarily
receive.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Influence of the Mind on the Body</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The influence of the mind on the body, as well as
of the body on the mind, should be emphasized. The
electric power of the brain, promoted by mental activity,
vitalizes the whole system, and is thus an invaluable aid
in resisting disease. This should be made plain. The
power of the will and the importance of self-control,
both in the preservation and in the recovery of health,
the depressing and even ruinous effect of anger, discontent,
selfishness, or impurity, and, on the other hand,
the marvelous life-giving power to be found in cheerfulness,
unselfishness, gratitude, should also be shown.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a physiological truth—truth that we need to
consider—in the scripture, “A merry [rejoicing] heart
doeth good like a medicine.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cheerfulness; Gratitude</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“Let thine heart keep My commandments,” God
says; “for length of days, and years of life, and peace,
shall they add to thee.” “They are life unto those
that find them, and health to all their flesh.” “Pleasant
words” the Scriptures declare to be not only “sweet
to the soul,” but “health to the bones.”<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c015'><sup>[320]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The youth need to understand the deep truth underlying
the Bible statement that with God “is the fountain
of life.”<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c015'><sup>[321]</sup></a> Not only is He the originator of all, but
He is the life of everything that lives. It is His life that
we receive in the sunshine, in the pure, sweet air, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the food which builds up our bodies and sustains our
strength. It is by His life that we exist, hour by hour,
moment by moment. Except as perverted by sin, all
His gifts tend to life, to health and joy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He hath made everything beautiful in its time;”<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c015'><sup>[322]</sup></a>
and true beauty will be secured, not in marring God’s
work, but in coming into harmony with the laws of
Him who created all things, and who finds pleasure
in their beauty and perfection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Right Physical Habits</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As the mechanism of the body is studied, attention
should be directed to its wonderful adaptation of means
to ends, the harmonious action and dependence of the
various organs. As the interest of the student is thus
awakened, and he is led to see the importance of
physical culture, much can be done by the teacher to
secure proper development and right habits.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Position</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Among the first things to be aimed at should be a
correct position, both in sitting and in standing. God
made man upright, and He desires him to possess not
only the physical but the mental and moral benefit, the
grace and dignity and self-possession, the courage and
self-reliance, which an erect bearing so greatly tends
to promote. Let the teacher give instruction on this
point by example and by precept. Show what a correct
position is, and insist that it shall be maintained.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Respiration</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Next in importance to right position are respiration
and vocal culture. The one who sits and stands erect
is more likely than others to breathe properly. But
the teacher should impress upon his pupils the importance
of deep breathing. Show how the healthy action
of the respiratory organs, assisting the circulation of the
blood, invigorates the whole system, excites the appetite,
promotes digestion, and induces sound, sweet sleep,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>thus not only refreshing the body, but soothing and
tranquilizing the mind. And while the importance of
deep breathing is shown, the practise should be insisted
upon. Let exercises be given which will promote this,
and see that the habit becomes established.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Training of the Voice</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The training of the voice has an important place in
physical culture, since it tends to expand and strengthen
the lungs, and thus to ward off disease. To insure
correct delivery in reading and speaking, see that the
abdominal muscles have full play in breathing, and that
the respiratory organs are unrestricted. Let the strain
come on the muscles of the abdomen, rather than on
those of the throat. Great weariness and serious disease
of the throat and lungs may thus be prevented.
Careful attention should be given to securing distinct
articulation, smooth, well-modulated tones, and a not-too-rapid
delivery. This will not only promote health,
but will add greatly to the agreeableness and efficiency
of the student’s work.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Healthful Dress</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In teaching these things a golden opportunity is
afforded for showing the folly and wickedness of tight-lacing,
and every other practise that restricts vital action.
An almost endless train of disease results from unhealthful
modes of dress, and careful instruction on this point
should be given. Impress upon the pupils the danger
of allowing the clothing to weigh on the hips or to
compress any organ of the body. The dress should be
so arranged that a full respiration can be taken, and
the arms be raised above the head without difficulty.
The cramping of the lungs not only prevents their
development, but hinders the processes of digestion
and circulation, and thus weakens the whole body.
All such practises lessen both physical and mental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>power, thus hindering the student’s advancement, and
often preventing his success.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cleanliness, Sunlight, Ventilation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the study of hygiene the earnest teacher will
improve every opportunity to show the necessity of
perfect cleanliness both in personal habits and in all
one’s surroundings. The value of the daily bath in
promoting health and in stimulating mental action,
should be emphasized. Attention should be given
also to sunlight and ventilation, the hygiene of the
sleeping-room and the kitchen. Teach the pupils that
a healthful sleeping-room, a thoroughly clean kitchen,
and a tastefully arranged, wholesomely supplied table,
will go farther toward securing the happiness of the
family and the regard of every sensible visitor than any
amount of expensive furnishing in the drawing-room.
That “the life is more than meat, and the body is
more than raiment,”<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c015'><sup>[323]</sup></a> is a lesson no less needed now
than when given by the divine Teacher eighteen hundred
years ago.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Knowledge Put to Use</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The student of physiology should be taught that
the object of his study is not merely to gain a knowledge
of facts and principles. This alone will prove of
little benefit. He may understand the importance of
ventilation; his room may be supplied with pure air;
but unless he fills his lungs properly, he will suffer
the results of imperfect respiration. So the necessity
of cleanliness may be understood, and needful facilities
may be supplied; but all will be without avail unless
put to use. The great requisite in teaching these principles
is to impress the pupil with their importance,
so that he will conscientiously put them in practise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Body God’s Dwelling-place</i></div>

<p class='c014'>By a most beautiful and impressive figure, God’s
word shows the regard He places upon our physical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>organism, and the responsibility resting on us to preserve
it in the best condition: “Know ye not that your
body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you,
which ye have from God? and ye are not your own.”
“If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God
destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple
ye are.”<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c015'><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Let pupils be impressed with the thought that the
body is a temple in which God desires to dwell; that it
must be kept pure, the abiding-place of high and noble
thoughts. As in the study of physiology they see that
they are indeed “fearfully and wonderfully made,”<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c015'><sup>[325]</sup></a> they
will be inspired with reverence. Instead of marring
God’s handiwork, they will have an ambition to make
all that is possible of themselves, in order to fulfil the
Creator’s glorious plan. Thus they will come to regard
obedience to the laws of health, not as a matter of
sacrifice or self-denial, but as it really is, an inestimable
privilege and blessing.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Plain Living; High Thinking</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Every student needs to understand the relation
between plain living and high thinking. It rests
with us individually to decide whether our lives shall
be controlled by the mind or by the body. The youth
must, each for himself, make the choice that shapes his
life; and no pains should be spared that he may understand
the forces with which he has to deal, and the
influences which mould character and destiny.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Prevention of Intemperance</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Intemperance is a foe against which all need to be
guarded. The rapid increase of this terrible evil should
arouse every lover of his race to warfare against it.
The practise of giving instruction on temperance topics
in the schools is a move in the right direction. Instruction
in this line should be given in every school
and in every home. The youth and children should
understand the effect of alcohol, tobacco, and other like
poisons, in breaking down the body, beclouding the
mind, and sensualizing the soul. It should be made
plain that no one who uses these things can long possess
the full strength of his physical, mental, or moral
faculties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Causes of Intemperance</i></div>

<p class='c014'>But in order to reach the root of intemperance we
must go deeper than the use of alcohol or tobacco.
Idleness, lack of aim, or evil associations, may be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>predisposing cause. Often it is found at the home table,
in families that account themselves strictly temperate.
Anything that disorders digestion, that creates undue
mental excitement, or in any way enfeebles the system,
disturbing the balance of the mental and the physical
powers, weakens the control of the mind over the body,
and thus tends toward intemperance. The downfall of
many a promising youth might be traced to unnatural
appetites created by an unwholesome diet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Stimulating Diet</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Tea and coffee, condiments, confectionery, and pastries
are all active causes of indigestion. Flesh-food
also is harmful. Its naturally stimulating effect should
be a sufficient argument against its use; and the almost
universally diseased condition of animals makes it doubly
objectionable. It tends to irritate the nerves and to
excite the passions, thus giving the balance of power
to the lower propensities.</p>

<p class='c014'>Those who accustom themselves to a rich, stimulating
diet, find after a time that the stomach is not
satisfied with simple food. It demands that which is
more and more highly seasoned, pungent, and stimulating.
As the nerves become disordered and the
system weakened, the will seems powerless to resist the
unnatural craving. The delicate coating of the stomach
becomes irritated and inflamed until the most stimulating
food fails of giving relief. A thirst is created that
nothing but strong drink will quench.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Self-Control the Safeguard</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is the beginnings of evil that should be guarded
against. In the instruction of the youth the effect of
apparently small deviations from the right should be
made very plain. Let the student be taught the value
of a simple, healthful diet in preventing the desire for
unnatural stimulants. Let the habit of self-control be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>early established. Let the youth be impressed with
the thought that they are to be masters, and not slaves.
Of the kingdom within them God has made them
rulers, and they are to exercise their Heaven-appointed
kingship. When such instruction is faithfully given,
the results will extend far beyond the youth themselves.
Influences will reach out that will save thousands of men
and women who are on the very brink of ruin.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Diet and Mental Development</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The relation of diet to intellectual development
should be given far more attention than it has received.
Mental confusion and dulness are often the result of
errors in diet.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is frequently urged that, in the selection of food,
appetite is a safe guide. If the laws of health had
always been obeyed, this would be true. But through
wrong habits, continued from generation to generation,
appetite has become so perverted that it is constantly
craving some hurtful gratification. As a guide it can
not now be trusted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nutrient Value of Foods</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the study of hygiene, students should be taught
the nutrient value of different foods. The effect of a
concentrated and stimulating diet, also of foods deficient
in the elements of nutrition, should be made plain.
Tea and coffee, fine-flour bread, pickles, coarse vegetables,
candies, condiments, and pastries fail of supplying
proper nutriment. Many a student has broken down as
the result of using such foods. Many a puny child,
incapable of vigorous effort of mind or body, is the
victim of an impoverished diet. Grains, fruits, nuts,
and vegetables, in proper combination, contain all the
elements of nutrition; and when properly prepared,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>they constitute the diet that best promotes both physical
and mental strength.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Selection; Combination</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There is need to consider not only the properties of
the food but its adaptation to the eater. Often food
that can be eaten freely by persons engaged in physical
labor must be avoided by those whose work is chiefly
mental. Attention should be given also to the proper
combination of foods. By brain-workers and others of
sedentary pursuits, but few kinds should be taken at a
meal.</p>

<p class='c014'>And overeating, even of the most wholesome food,
is to be guarded against. Nature can use no more
than is required for building up the various organs of
the body, and excess clogs the system. Many a student
is supposed to have broken down from overstudy,
when the real cause was overeating. While proper
attention is given to the laws of health, there is little
danger from mental taxation; but in many cases of
so-called mental failure, it is the overcrowding of the
stomach that wearies the body and weakens the mind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Regularity in Eating and Sleeping</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In most cases, two meals a day are preferable to
three. Supper, when taken at an early hour, interferes
with the digestion of the previous meal. When taken
later, it is not itself digested before bedtime. Thus
the stomach fails of securing proper rest. The sleep
is disturbed, the brain and nerves are wearied, the
appetite for breakfast is impaired, the whole system
is unrefreshed, and is unready for the day’s duties.</p>

<p class='c014'>The importance of regularity in the time for eating
and sleeping should not be overlooked. Since the work
of building up the body takes place during the hours of
rest, it is essential, especially in youth, that sleep should
be regular and abundant.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>So far as possible, we should avoid hurried eating.
The shorter the time for a meal, the less should be
eaten. It is better to omit a meal than to eat without
proper mastication.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Social Season</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Meal-time should be a season for social intercourse
and refreshment. Everything that can burden or irritate
should be banished. Let trust and kindliness and
gratitude to the Giver of all good be cherished, and the
conversation will be cheerful, a pleasant flow of thought
that will uplift without wearying.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Benefits of Temperance</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The observance of temperance and regularity in all
things has a wonderful power. It will do more than
circumstances or natural endowments in promoting that
sweetness and serenity of disposition which count so
much in smoothing life’s pathway. At the same time
the power of self-control thus acquired will be found
one of the most valuable of equipments for grappling
successfully with the stern duties and realities that
await every human being.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wisdom’s “ways are ways of pleasantness, and all

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>There is a distinction between recreation and

us aside from our ordinary cares and occupations, it

us to return with new vigor to the earnest work of life.
Amusement, on the other hand, is sought for the sake
of pleasure, and is often carried to excess; it absorbs
the energies that are required for useful work, and thus
proves a hindrance to life’s true success.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Physical Inaction; the Child</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The whole body is designed for action; and unless
the physical powers are kept in health by active exercise,
the mental powers can not long be used to their
highest capacity. The physical inaction which seems
almost inevitable in the schoolroom—together with
other unhealthful conditions—makes it a trying place
for children, especially for those of feeble constitution.
Often the ventilation is insufficient. Ill-formed seats
encourage unnatural positions, thus cramping the action
of the lungs and the heart. Here little children have
to spend from three to five hours a day, breathing air
that is laden with impurity and perhaps infected with
the germs of disease. No wonder that in the schoolroom
the foundation of lifelong illness is so often laid.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>The brain, the most delicate of all the physical organs,
and that from which the nervous energy of the whole
system is derived, suffers the greatest injury. By being
forced into premature or excessive activity, and this
under unhealthful conditions, it is enfeebled, and often
the evil results are permanent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Outdoor Life for Children</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Children should not be long confined within doors,
nor should they be required to apply themselves closely
to study until a good foundation has been laid for physical
development. For the first eight or ten years of a
child’s life the field or garden is the best schoolroom,
the mother the best teacher, nature the best lesson-book.
Even when the child is old enough to attend school,
his health should be regarded as of greater importance
than a knowledge of books. He should be surrounded
with the conditions most favorable to both physical and
mental growth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Physical Inaction; the Student</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The child is not alone in the danger from want of
air and exercise. In the higher as well as the lower
schools these essentials to health are still too often
neglected. Many a student sits day after day in a
close room bending over his books, his chest so contracted
that he can not take a full, deep breath, his
blood moving sluggishly, his feet cold, his head hot.
The body not being sufficiently nourished, the muscles
are weakened, and the whole system is enervated and
diseased. Often such students become lifelong invalids.
They might have come from school with increased
physical as well as mental strength, had they pursued
their studies under proper conditions, with regular exercise
in the sunlight and the open air.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mental Effect</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The student who with limited time and means is
struggling to gain an education should realize that time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>spent in physical exercise is not lost. He who continually
pores over his books will find, after a time, that the
mind has lost its freshness. Those who give proper
attention to physical development will make greater
advancement in literary lines than they would if their
entire time were devoted to study.</p>

<p class='c014'>By pursuing one line of thought exclusively, the
mind often becomes unbalanced. But every faculty
may be safely exercised if the mental and physical
powers are equally taxed, and the subjects of thought
are varied.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Moral Effect</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Physical inaction lessens not only mental but moral
power. The brain nerves that connect with the whole
system are the medium through which heaven communicates
with man, and affects the inmost life. Whatever
hinders the circulation of the electric current in the
nervous system, thus weakening the vital powers and
lessening mental susceptibility, makes it more difficult
to arouse the moral nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, excessive study, by increasing the flow of
blood to the brain, creates morbid excitability that tends
to lessen the power of self-control, and too often gives
sway to impulse or caprice. Thus the door is opened
to impurity. The misuse or nonuse of the physical
powers is largely responsible for the tide of corruption
that is overspreading the world. “Pride, fulness of
bread, and abundance of idleness,” are as deadly foes
to human progress in this generation as when they led
to the destruction of Sodom.</p>

<p class='c014'>Teachers should understand these things, and should
instruct their pupils in these lines. Teach the students
that right living depends on right thinking, and that
physical activity is essential to purity of thought.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gymnastic Exercises</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>The question of suitable recreation for their pupils
is one that teachers often find perplexing. Gymnastic
exercises fill a useful place in many schools; but without
careful supervision they are often carried to excess.
In the gymnasium many youth, by their attempted feats
of strength, have done themselves lifelong injury.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tendency of Sports</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Exercise in a gymnasium, however well conducted,
can not supply the place of recreation in the open air,
and for this our schools should afford better opportunity.
Vigorous exercise the pupils must have. Few
evils are more to be dreaded than indolence and aimlessness.
Yet the tendency of most athletic sports is
a subject of anxious thought to those who have at heart
the well-being of the youth. Teachers are troubled as
they consider the influence of these sports both on the
student’s progress in school and on his success in after-life.
The games that occupy so much of his time are
diverting the mind from study. They are not helping
to prepare the youth for practical, earnest work in
life. Their influence does not tend toward refinement,
generosity, or real manliness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Football and Boxing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Some of the most popular amusements, such as
football and boxing, have become schools of brutality.
They are developing the same characteristics as did the
games of ancient Rome. The love of domination, the
pride in mere brute force, the reckless disregard of life,
are exerting upon the youth a power to demoralize
that is appalling.</p>

<p class='c014'>Other athletic games, though not so brutalizing,
are scarcely less objectionable, because of the excess
to which they are carried. They stimulate the love of
pleasure and excitement, thus fostering a distaste for
useful labor, a disposition to shun practical duties and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>responsibilities. They tend to destroy a relish for life’s
sober realities and its tranquil enjoyments. Thus the
door is opened to dissipation and lawlessness, with their
terrible results.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Parties of Pleasure</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As ordinarily conducted, parties of pleasure also
are a hindrance to real growth, either of mind or
of character. Frivolous associations, habits of extravagance,
of pleasure-seeking, and too often of dissipation,
are formed, that shape the whole life for evil. In place
of such amusements, parents and teachers can do much
to supply diversions wholesome and life-giving.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Simple Habits in Earlier Ages</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In this, as in all things else that concern our well-being,
Inspiration has pointed the way. In early ages,
with the people who were under God’s direction, life
was simple. They lived close to the heart of nature.
Their children shared in the labor of the parents, and
studied the beauties and mysteries of nature’s treasure-house.
And in the quiet of field and wood they pondered
those mighty truths handed down as a sacred
trust from generation to generation. Such training
produced strong men.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this age, life has become artificial, and men have
degenerated. While we may not return fully to the
simple habits of those early times, we may learn from
them lessons that will make our seasons of recreation
what the name implies,—seasons of true upbuilding for
body and mind and soul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Outdoor Occupations</i></div>

<p class='c014'>With the question of recreation the surroundings of
the home and the school have much to do. In the
choice of a home or the location of a school these things
should be considered. Those with whom mental and
physical well-being is of greater moment than money or
the claims and customs of society, should seek for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>children the benefit of nature’s teaching, and recreation
amidst her surroundings. It would be a great aid in
educational work could every school be so situated as
to afford the pupils land for cultivation, and access to
the fields and woods.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Teacher’s Co-operation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In lines of recreation for the student, the best results
will be attained through the personal co-operation of the
teacher. The true teacher can impart to his pupils few
gifts so valuable as the gift of his own companionship.
It is true of men and women, and how much more of
youth and children, that only as we come in touch
through sympathy can we understand them; and we
need to understand in order most effectively to benefit.
To strengthen the tie of sympathy between teacher and
student there are few means that count so much as
pleasant association together outside the schoolroom.
In some schools the teacher is always with his pupils
in their hours of recreation. He unites in their pursuits,
accompanies them in their excursions, and seems
to make himself one with them. Well would it be for
our schools were this practise more generally followed.
The sacrifice demanded of the teacher would be great,
but he would reap a rich reward.</p>

<p class='c014'>No recreation helpful only to themselves will prove
so great a blessing to the children and youth as that
which makes them helpful to others. Naturally enthusiastic
and impressible, the young are quick to respond
to suggestion. In planning for the culture of plants,
let the teacher seek to awaken an interest in beautifying
the school-grounds and the schoolroom. A double
benefit will result. That which the pupils seek to
beautify they will be unwilling to have marred or
defaced. A refined taste, a love of order, and a habit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>of care-taking will be encouraged; and the spirit of
fellowship and co-operation developed will prove to
the pupils a lifelong blessing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Encourage Helpfulness</i></div>

<p class='c014'>So also a new interest may be given to the work
of the garden or the excursion in field or wood, as
the pupils are encouraged to remember those shut in
from these pleasant places, and to share with them
the beautiful things of nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>The watchful teacher will find many opportunities
for directing pupils to acts of helpfulness. By little
children especially the teacher is regarded with almost
unbounded confidence and respect. Whatever he may
suggest as to ways of helping in the home, faithfulness
in the daily tasks, ministry to the sick or
the poor, can hardly fail of bringing forth fruit. And
thus again a double gain will be secured. The kindly
suggestion will react upon its author. Gratitude and
co-operation on the part of the parents will lighten the
teacher’s burden and brighten his path.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Safeguard against Evil</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Attention to recreation and physical culture will at
times, no doubt, interrupt the regular routine of school
work; but the interruption will prove no real hindrance.
In the invigoration of mind and body, the fostering of
an unselfish spirit, and the binding together of pupil
and teacher by the ties of common interest and friendly
association, the expenditure of time and effort will be
repaid a hundredfold. A blessed outlet will be afforded
for that restless energy which is so often a source of
danger to the young. As a safeguard against evil, the
preoccupation of the mind with good is worth more
than unnumbered barriers of law and discipline.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Labor a Blessing</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>At the creation, labor was appointed as a blessing.
It meant development, power, happiness. The
changed condition of the earth through the curse of
sin has brought a change in the conditions of labor;
yet though now attended with anxiety, weariness, and
pain, it is still a source of happiness and development.
And it is a safeguard against temptation. Its discipline
places a check on self-indulgence, and promotes
industry, purity, and firmness. Thus it becomes a part
of God’s great plan for our recovery from the fall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dignity of Labor</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The youth should be led to see the true dignity of
labor. Show them that God is a constant worker.
All things in nature do their allotted work. Action
pervades the whole creation, and in order to fulfil our
mission we too must be active.</p>

<p class='c014'>In our labor we are to be workers together with
God. He gives us the earth and its treasures; but we
must adapt them to our use and comfort. He causes
the trees to grow; but we prepare the timber and build
the house. He has hidden in the earth the gold and
silver, the iron and coal; but it is only through toil that
we can obtain them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Co-workers with God</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Show that, while God has created and constantly
controls all things, He has endowed us with a power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>not wholly unlike His. To us has been given a degree
of control over the forces of nature. As God called
forth the earth in its beauty out of chaos, so we can
bring order and beauty out of confusion. And though
all things are now marred with evil, yet in our completed
work we feel a joy akin to His, when, looking
on the fair earth, He pronounced it “very good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As a rule, the exercise most beneficial to the youth
will be found in useful employment. The little child
finds both diversion and development in play; and his
sports should be such as to promote not only physical
but mental and spiritual growth. As he gains strength
and intelligence, the best recreation will be found in
some line of effort that is useful. That which trains
the hand to helpfulness, and teaches the young to bear
their share of life’s burdens, is most effective in promoting
the growth of mind and character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>An Essential Discipline</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The youth need to be taught that life means earnest
work, responsibility, care-taking. They need a training
that will make them practical,—men and women who
can cope with emergencies. They should be taught
that the discipline of systematic, well-regulated labor is
essential, not only as a safeguard against the vicissitudes
of life, but as an aid to all-round development.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Idleness Degrading</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Notwithstanding all that has been said and written
concerning the dignity of labor, the feeling prevails that
it is degrading. Young men are anxious to become
teachers, clerks, merchants, physicians, lawyers, or to
occupy some other position that does not require physical
toil. Young women shun housework, and seek an
education in other lines. These need to learn that no
man or woman is degraded by honest toil. That which
degrades is idleness and selfish dependence. Idleness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>fosters self-indulgence, and the result is a life empty
and barren,—a field inviting the growth of every evil.
“The earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft
upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by
whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God; but
that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is
nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.”<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c015'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Many of the branches of study that consume the
students’ time are not essential to usefulness or happiness;
but it is essential for every youth to have a
thorough acquaintance with every-day duties. If need
be, a young woman can dispense with a knowledge of
French and algebra, or even of the piano; but it is
indispensable that she learn to make good bread, to
fashion neatly-fitting garments, and to perform efficiently
the many duties that pertain to home-making.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Knowledge of Common Duties</i></div>

<p class='c014'>To the health and happiness of the whole family
nothing is more vital than skill and intelligence on
the part of the cook. By ill-prepared, unwholesome
food she may hinder and even ruin both the adult’s
usefulness and the child’s development. Or by providing
food adapted to the needs of the body, and at the
same time inviting and palatable, she can accomplish
as much in the right as otherwise she accomplishes in
the wrong direction. So, in many ways, life’s happiness
is bound up with faithfulness in common duties.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since both men and women have a part in home-making,
boys as well as girls should gain a knowledge
of household duties. To make a bed and put a room
in order, to wash dishes, to prepare a meal, to wash
and repair his own clothing, is a training that need not
make any boy less manly; it will make him happier
and more useful. And if girls, in turn, could learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>to harness and drive a horse, and to use the saw and
the hammer, as well as the rake and the hoe, they
would be better fitted to meet the emergencies of life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Honor to the Toiler</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Let the children and youth learn from the Bible
how God has honored the work of the every-day toiler.
Let them read of the “sons of the prophets,”<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c015'><sup>[329]</sup></a> students
at school, who were building a house for themselves,
and for whom a miracle was wrought to save from loss
the ax that was borrowed. Let them read of Jesus the
carpenter, and Paul the tent-maker, who with the toil of
the craftsman linked the highest ministry, human and
divine. Let them read of the lad whose five loaves
were used by the Saviour in that wonderful miracle
for the feeding of the multitude; of Dorcas the seamstress,
called back from death, that she might continue
to make garments for the poor; of the wise woman described
in the Proverbs, who “seeketh wool and flax,
and worketh willingly with her hands;” who “giveth
meat to her household, and their task to her maidens;”
who “planteth a vineyard,&nbsp;... and strengtheneth
her arms;” who “stretcheth out her hand to the poor;
yea,&nbsp;... reacheth forth her hands to the needy;”
who “looketh well to the ways of her household, and
eateth not the bread of idleness.”<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c015'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Of such a one, God says: “She shall be praised.
Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own
works praise her in the gates.”<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c015'><sup>[331]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>First Industrial School</i></div>

<p class='c014'>For every child the first industrial school should be
the home. And, so far as possible, facilities for manual
training should be connected with every school. To a
great degree such training would supply the place of
the gymnasium, with the additional benefit of affording
valuable discipline.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Schools for Manual Training</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Manual training is deserving of far more attention
than it has received. Schools should be established
that, in addition to the highest mental and moral culture,
shall provide the best possible facilities for physical
development and industrial training. Instruction
should be given in agriculture, manufactures,—covering
as many as possible of the most useful trades,—also in
household economy, healthful cookery, sewing, hygienic
dressmaking, the treatment of the sick, and kindred
lines. Gardens, workshops, and treatment-rooms should
be provided, and the work in every line should be under
the direction of skilled instructors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Learning a Trade</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The work should have a definite aim, and should
be thorough. While every person needs some knowledge
of different handicrafts, it is indispensable that he
become proficient in at least one. Every youth, on
leaving school, should have acquired a knowledge of
some trade or occupation by which, if need be, he
may earn a livelihood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Financial Outlay</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The objection most often urged against industrial
training in the schools is the large outlay involved.
But the object to be gained is worthy of its cost. No
other work committed to us is so important as the training
of the youth, and every outlay demanded for its
right accomplishment is means well spent.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even from the view-point of financial results, the
outlay required for manual training would prove the
truest economy. Multitudes of our boys would thus
be kept from the street-corner and the groggery; the
expenditure for gardens, workshops, and baths would
be more than met by the saving on hospitals and
reformatories. And the youth themselves, trained to
habits of industry, and skilled in lines of useful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>productive labor,—who can estimate their value to
society and to the nation?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Agriculture</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As a relaxation from study, occupations pursued in
the open air, and affording exercise for the whole body,
are the most beneficial. No line of manual training is
of more value than agriculture. A greater effort should
be made to create and to encourage an interest in agricultural
pursuits. Let the teacher call attention to what
the Bible says about agriculture: that it was God’s plan
for man to till the earth; that the first man, the ruler of
the whole world, was given a garden to cultivate; and
that many of the world’s greatest men, its real nobility,
have been tillers of the soil. Show the opportunities in
such a life. The wise man says, “The king himself is
served by the field.”<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c015'><sup>[332]</sup></a> Of him who cultivates the soil
the Bible declares, “His God doth instruct him to discretion,
and doth teach him.” And again, “Whoso
keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof.”<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c015'><sup>[333]</sup></a> He
who earns his livelihood by agriculture escapes many
temptations and enjoys unnumbered privileges and
blessings denied to those whose work lies in the great
cities. And in these days of mammoth trusts and
business competition, there are few who enjoy so real
an independence and so great certainty of fair return
for their labor as does the tiller of the soil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Teaching to be Practical</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the study of agriculture, let pupils be given not
only theory, but practise. While they learn what science
can teach in regard to the nature and preparation
of the soil, the value of different crops, and the best
methods of production, let them put their knowledge to
use. Let teachers share the work with the students,
and show what results can be achieved through skilful,
intelligent effort. Thus may be awakened a genuine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>interest, an ambition to do the work in the best possible
manner. Such an ambition, together with the invigorating
effect of exercise, sunshine, and pure air, will create
a love for agricultural labor that with many youth will
determine their choice of an occupation. Thus might
be set on foot influences that would go far in turning the
tide of migration which now sets so strongly toward the
great cities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>For the Unemployed</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Thus also our schools could aid effectively in the
disposition of the unemployed masses. Thousands of
helpless and starving beings, whose numbers are daily
swelling the ranks of the criminal classes, might achieve
self-support in a happy, healthy, independent life if they
could be directed in skilful, diligent labor in the tilling
of the soil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Training for Professional Men</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The benefit of manual training is needed also by
professional men. A man may have a brilliant mind;
he may be quick to catch ideas; his knowledge and
skill may secure for him admission to his chosen calling;
yet he may still be far from possessing a fitness for its
duties. An education derived chiefly from books leads
to superficial thinking. Practical work encourages close
observation and independent thought. Rightly performed,
it tends to develop that practical wisdom which
we call common sense. It develops ability to plan and
execute, strengthens courage and perseverance, and calls
for the exercise of tact and skill.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Benefit to the Physician</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The physician who has laid a foundation for his professional
knowledge by actual service in the sick-room
will have a quickness of insight, an all-round knowledge,
and an ability in emergencies to render needed
service,—all essential qualifications, which only a practical
training can so fully impart.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>To Minister, Missionary, Teacher</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The minister, the missionary, the teacher, will find
their influence with the people greatly increased when
it is manifest that they possess the knowledge and skill
required for the practical duties of every-day life. And
often the success, perhaps the very life, of the missionary,
depends on his knowledge of practical things. The
ability to prepare food, to deal with accidents and emergencies,
to treat disease, to build a house, or a church
if need be,—often these make all the difference between
success and failure in his life-work.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Students Self-Sustaining</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In acquiring an education, many students would
gain a most valuable training if they would become
self-sustaining. Instead of incurring debts, or depending
on the self-denial of their parents, let young men
and young women depend on themselves. They will
thus learn the value of money, the value of time,
strength, and opportunities, and will be under far less
temptation to indulge idle and spendthrift habits. The
lessons of economy, industry, self-denial, practical business
management, and steadfastness of purpose, thus
mastered, would prove a most important part of their
equipment for the battle of life. And the lesson of
self-help learned by the student would go far toward
preserving institutions of learning from the burden
of debt under which so many schools have struggled,
and which has done so much toward crippling their
usefulness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let the youth be impressed with the thought that
education is not to teach them how to escape life’s
disagreeable tasks and heavy burdens; that its purpose
is to lighten the work by teaching better methods and
higher aims. Teach them that life’s true aim is not
to secure the greatest possible gain for themselves, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to honor their Maker in doing their part of the world’s
work, and lending a helpful hand to those weaker or
more ignorant.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Accuracy and Thoroughness</i></div>

<p class='c014'>One great reason why physical toil is looked down
on is the slipshod, unthinking way in which it is so
often performed. It is done from necessity, not from
choice. The worker puts no heart into it, and he
neither preserves self-respect nor wins the respect of
others. Manual training should correct this error. It
should develop habits of accuracy and thoroughness.
Pupils should learn tact and system; they should learn
to economize time, and to make every move count.
They should not only be taught the best methods,
but be inspired with ambition constantly to improve.
Let it be their aim to make their work as nearly
perfect as human brains and hands can make it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Masters of Labor</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Such training will make the youth masters and not
slaves of labor. It will lighten the lot of the hard
toiler, and will ennoble even the humblest occupation.
He who regards work as mere drudgery, and settles
down to it with self-complacent ignorance, making no
effort to improve, will find it indeed a burden. But
those who recognize science in the humblest work will
see in it nobility and beauty, and will take pleasure in
performing it with faithfulness and efficiency.</p>

<p class='c014'>A youth so trained, whatever his calling in life, so
long as it is honest, will make his position one of
usefulness and honor.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Character the Highest Aim</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>True education does not ignore the value of scientific
knowledge or literary acquirements; but above
information it values power; above power, goodness;
above intellectual acquirements, character. The world
does not so much need men of great intellect as of
noble character. It needs men in whom ability is controlled
by steadfast principle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get
wisdom.” “The tongue of the wise useth knowledge
aright.”<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c015'><sup>[334]</sup></a> True education imparts this wisdom. It
teaches the best use not only of one but of all our
powers and acquirements. Thus it covers the whole
circle of obligation,—to ourselves, to the world, and
to God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Outlook for the Youth</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Character-building is the most important work ever
entrusted to human beings; and never before was its
diligent study so important as now. Never was any
previous generation called to meet issues so momentous;
never before were young men and young women confronted
by perils so great as confront them to-day.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Perils in the Schools</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rivalry</i></div>

<p class='c014'>At such a time as this, what is the trend of the
education given? To what motive is appeal most often
made?—To self-seeking. Much of the education given
is a perversion of the name. In true education the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>selfish ambition, the greed for power, the disregard for
the rights and needs of humanity, that are the curse of
our world, find a counter-influence. God’s plan of life
has a place for every human being. Each is to improve
his talents to the utmost; and faithfulness in doing this,
be the gifts few or many, entitles one to honor. In
God’s plan there is no place for selfish rivalry. Those
who “measure themselves by themselves, and compare
themselves among themselves, are not wise.” Whatever
we do is to be done “as of the ability which God
giveth.” It is to be done “heartily, as to the Lord,
and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall
receive the reward of the inheritance; for ye serve the
Lord Christ.”<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c015'><sup>[335]</sup></a> Precious the service done and the education
gained in carrying out these principles. But how
widely different is much of the education now given!
From the child’s earliest years it is an appeal to emulation
and rivalry; it fosters selfishness, the root of all evil.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus is created strife for supremacy; and there is
encouraged the system of “cramming,” which in so
many cases destroys health and unfits for usefulness.
In many others, emulation leads to dishonesty; and by
fostering ambition and discontent, it embitters the life,
and helps to fill the world with those restless, turbulent
spirits that are a continual menace to society.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor does danger pertain to methods only. It is
found also in the subject-matter of the studies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pagan Authors</i></div>

<p class='c014'>What are the works on which, throughout the most
susceptible years of life, the minds of the youth are led
to dwell? In the study of language and literature, from
what fountains are the youth taught to drink?—From
the wells of paganism; from springs fed by the corruptions
of ancient heathendom. They are bidden to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>study authors, of whom, without dispute, it is declared
that they have no regard for the principles of morality.</p>

<p class='c014'>And of how many modern authors also might the
same be said! With how many are grace and beauty
of language but a disguise for principles that in their
real deformity would repel the reader!</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Fiction</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Besides these there is a multitude of fiction-writers,
luring to pleasant dreams in palaces of ease. These
writers may not be open to the charge of immorality,
yet their work is no less really fraught with evil. It
is robbing thousands upon thousands of the time and
energy and self-discipline demanded by the stern problems
of life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>False Science</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the study of science, as generally pursued, there
are dangers equally great. Evolution and its kindred
errors are taught in schools of every grade, from the
kindergarten to the college. Thus the study of science,
which should impart a knowledge of God, is so mingled
with the speculations and theories of men that it tends
to infidelity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Higher Criticism</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>Even Bible study, as too often conducted in the
schools, is robbing the world of the priceless treasure
of the word of God. The work of “higher criticism,”
in dissecting, conjecturing, reconstructing, is destroying
faith in the Bible as a divine revelation; it is robbing
God’s word of power to control, uplift, and inspire
human lives.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the youth go out into the world, to encounter
its allurements to sin,—the passion for money-getting,
for amusement and indulgence, for display, luxury, and
extravagance, the overreaching, fraud, robbery, and ruin,—what
are the teachings there to be met?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Perils in the World</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Spiritualism asserts that men are unfallen demigods;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>that “each mind will judge itself;” that “true knowledge
places men above all law;” that “all sins committed
are innocent;” for “whatever is, is right,” and
“God doth not condemn.” The basest of human beings
it represents as in heaven, and highly exalted there.
Thus it declares to all men, “It matters not what you
do; live as you please, heaven is your home.” Multitudes
are thus led to believe that desire is the highest
law, that license is liberty, and that man is accountable
only to himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>With such teaching given at the very outset of life,
when impulse is strongest, and the demand for self-restraint
and purity is most urgent, where are the safeguards
of virtue? what is to prevent the world from
becoming a second Sodom?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Anarchy</i></div>

<p class='c014'>At the same time anarchy is seeking to sweep away
all law, not only divine, but human. The centralizing
of wealth and power; the vast combinations for the
enriching of the few at the expense of the many; the
combinations of the poorer classes for the defense of
their interests and claims; the spirit of unrest, of riot
and bloodshed; the world-wide dissemination of the
same teachings that led to the French Revolution,—all
are tending to involve the whole world in a struggle
similar to that which convulsed France.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such are the influences to be met by the youth of
to-day. To stand amidst such upheavals they are now
to lay the foundations of character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Foundation of Character</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In every generation and in every land the true foundation
and pattern for character-building have been the
same. The divine law, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart,&nbsp;... and thy neighbor
as thyself,”<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c015'><sup>[336]</sup></a> the great principle made manifest in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>character and life of our Saviour, is the only secure
foundation and the only sure guide.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The stability of thy times and the strength of
thy happiness shall be wisdom and knowledge,”<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c015'><sup>[337]</sup></a>—that
wisdom and knowledge which God’s word alone
can impart.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>God’s Commandments</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is as true now as when the words were spoken
to Israel of obedience to His commandments: “This is
your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of
the nations.”<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c015'><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Here is the only safeguard for individual integrity,
for the purity of the home, the well-being of society, or
the stability of the nation. Amidst all life’s perplexities
and dangers and conflicting claims, the one safe and
sure rule is to do what God says. “The statutes of
the Lord are right,” and “he that doeth these things
shall never be moved.”<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c015'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Memory Training</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>For ages education has had to do chiefly with the
memory. This faculty has been taxed to the
utmost, while the other mental powers have not been
correspondingly developed. Students have spent their
time in laboriously crowding the mind with knowledge,
very little of which could be utilized. The mind thus
burdened with that which it can not digest and assimilate
is weakened; it becomes incapable of vigorous, self-reliant
effort, and is content to depend on the judgment
and perception of others.</p>

<p class='c014'>Seeing the evils of this method, some have gone
to another extreme. In their view, man needs only
to develop that which is within him. Such education
leads the student to self-sufficiency, thus cutting him off
from the source of true knowledge and power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Inability to Discriminate</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The education that consists in the training of the
memory, tending to discourage independent thought,
has a moral bearing which is too little appreciated. As
the student sacrifices the power to reason and judge for
himself, he becomes incapable of discriminating between
truth and error, and falls an easy prey to deception.
He is easily led to follow tradition and custom.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a fact widely ignored, though never without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>danger, that error rarely appears for what it really is.
It is by mingling with or attaching itself to truth that
it gains acceptance. The eating of the tree of knowledge
of good and evil caused the ruin of our first
parents, and the acceptance of a mingling of good and
evil is the ruin of men and women to-day. The mind
that depends upon the judgment of others is certain,
sooner or later, to be misled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Reason and Faith</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The power to discriminate between right and wrong
we can possess only through individual dependence upon
God. Each for himself is to learn from Him through
His word. Our reasoning powers were given us for
use, and God desires them to be exercised. “Come
now, and let us reason together,”<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c015'><sup>[340]</sup></a> He invites us. In
reliance upon Him we may have wisdom to “refuse
the evil, and choose the good.”<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c015'><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Individual Development</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In all true teaching the personal element is essential.
Christ in His teaching dealt with men individually. It
was by personal contact and association that He trained
the twelve. It was in private, often to but one listener,
that He gave His most precious instruction. To the
honored rabbi at the night conference on the Mount of
Olives, to the despised woman at the well of Sychar,
He opened His richest treasures; for in these hearers
He discerned the impressible heart, the open mind,
the receptive spirit. Even the crowd that so often
thronged His steps was not to Christ an indiscriminate
mass of human beings. He spoke directly to every
mind and appealed to every heart. He watched the
faces of His hearers, marked the lighting up of the
countenance, the quick, responsive glance, which told
that truth had reached the soul; and there vibrated in
His heart the answering chord of sympathetic joy.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Christ discerned the possibilities in every human
being. He was not turned aside by an unpromising
exterior or by unfavorable surroundings. He called
Matthew from the toll-booth, and Peter and his brethren
from the fishing boat, to learn of Him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Present Need</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The same personal interest, the same attention to
individual development, are needed in educational work
to-day. Many apparently unpromising youth are richly
endowed with talents that are put to no use. Their
faculties lie hidden because of a lack of discernment
on the part of their educators. In many a boy or
girl outwardly as unattractive as a rough-hewn stone,
may be found precious material that will stand the test
of heat and storm and pressure. The true educator,
keeping in view what his pupils may become, will recognize
the value of the material upon which he is
working. He will take a personal interest in each
pupil, and will seek to develop all his powers. However
imperfect, every effort to conform to right principles
will be encouraged.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Application</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Every youth should be taught the necessity and the
power of application. Upon this, far more than upon
genius or talent, does success depend. Without application
the most brilliant talents avail little, while with
rightly directed effort persons of very ordinary natural
abilities have accomplished wonders. And genius, at
whose achievements we marvel, is almost invariably
united with untiring, concentrated effort.</p>

<p class='c014'>The youth should be taught to aim at the development
of all their faculties, the weaker as well as the
stronger. With many there is a disposition to restrict
their study to certain lines, for which they have a
natural liking. This error should be guarded against.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>The natural aptitudes indicate the direction of the life-work,
and, when legitimate, should be carefully cultivated.
At the same time it must be kept in mind
that a well-balanced character and efficient work in
any line depend, to a great degree, on that symmetrical
development which is the result of thorough, all-round
training.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Simplicity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The teacher should constantly aim at simplicity
and effectiveness. He should teach largely by illustration,
and even in dealing with older pupils should
be careful to make every explanation plain and clear.
Many pupils well advanced in years are but children
in understanding.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Enthusiasm</i></div>

<p class='c014'>An important element in educational work is enthusiasm.
On this point there is a useful suggestion in a
remark once made by a celebrated actor. The Archbishop
of Canterbury had put to him the question why
actors in a play affect their audiences so powerfully by
speaking of things imaginary, while ministers of the
gospel often affect theirs so little by speaking of things
real. “With due submission to your grace,” replied
the actor, “permit me to say that the reason is plain:
it lies in the power of enthusiasm. We on the stage
speak of things imaginary as if they were real, and
you in the pulpit speak of things real as if they were
imaginary.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The teacher in his work is dealing with things real,
and he should speak of them with all the force and
enthusiasm which a knowledge of their reality and
importance can inspire.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every teacher should see to it that his work tends
to definite results. Before attempting to teach a subject,
he should have a distinct plan in mind, and should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>know just what he desires to accomplish. He should
not rest satisfied with the presentation of any subject
until the student understands the principle involved,
perceives its truth, and is able to state clearly what
he has learned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mastery of Fundamentals</i></div>

<p class='c014'>So long as the great purpose of education is kept
in view, the youth should be encouraged to advance
just as far as their capabilities will permit. But before
taking up the higher branches of study, let them master
the lower. This is too often neglected. Even among
students in the higher schools and the colleges, there is
great deficiency in knowledge of the common branches
of education. Many students devote their time to
higher mathematics, when they are incapable of keeping
simple accounts. Many study elocution with a
view to acquiring the graces of oratory, when they are
unable to read in an intelligible and impressive manner.
Many who have finished the study of rhetoric fail in
the composition and spelling of an ordinary letter.</p>

<p class='c014'>A thorough knowledge of the essentials of education
should be not only the condition of admission to
a higher course, but the constant test for continuance
and advancement.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Language</i></div>

<p class='c014'>And in every branch of education there are objects
to be gained more important than those secured by
mere technical knowledge. Take language, for example.
More important than the acquirement of foreign languages,
living or dead, is the ability to write and speak
one’s mother-tongue with ease and accuracy; but no
training gained through a knowledge of grammatical
rules can compare in importance with the study of language
from a higher point of view. With this study, to
a great degree, is bound up life’s weal or woe.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Chief Requisite</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>The chief requisite of language is that it be pure
and kind and true,—“the outward expression of an
inward grace.” God says: “Whatsoever things are
true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things
are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things
are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if
there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think
on these things.”<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c015'><sup>[342]</sup></a> And if such are the thoughts, such
will be the expression.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Habits of Speech</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The best school for this language-study is the home;
but since the work of the home is so often neglected, it
devolves on the teacher to aid his pupils in forming
right habits of speech.</p>

<p class='c014'>The teacher can do much to discourage that evil
habit, the curse of the community, the neighborhood,
and the home,—the habit of backbiting, gossip, ungenerous
criticism. In this no pains should be spared.
Impress upon the students the fact that this habit
reveals a lack of culture and refinement and of true
goodness of heart; it unfits one both for the society
of the truly cultured and refined in this world and for
association with the holy ones of heaven.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gossip; Cannibalism</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We think with horror of the cannibal who feasts
on the still warm and trembling flesh of his victim; but
are the results of even this practise more terrible than
are the agony and ruin caused by misrepresenting
motive, blackening reputation, dissecting character?
Let the children, and the youth as well, learn what
God says about these things:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Death and life are in the power of the tongue.”<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c015'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In Scripture, backbiters are classed with “haters of
God,” with “inventors of evil things,” with those who
are “without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity.” It
is “the judgment of God, that they which commit such
things are worthy of death.”<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c015'><sup>[344]</sup></a> He whom God accounts
a citizen of Zion is he that “speaketh the truth in his
heart;” “that backbiteth not with his tongue,” “nor
taketh up a reproach against his neighbor.”<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c015'><sup>[345]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Expletive, Exaggeration</i></div>

<p class='c014'>God’s word condemns also the use of those meaningless
phrases and expletives that border on profanity.
It condemns the deceptive compliments, the evasions of
truth, the exaggerations, the misrepresentations in trade,
that are current in society and in the business world.
“Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; and whatsoever
is more than these is of the evil one.”<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c015'><sup>[346]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“As a madman who casteth firebrands, arrows, and
death, so is the man that deceiveth his neighbor, and
saith, Am not I in sport?”<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c015'><sup>[347]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Innuendo</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Closely allied to gossip is the covert insinuation,
the sly innuendo, by which the unclean in heart seek
to insinuate the evil they dare not openly express.
Every approach to these practises the youth should be
taught to shun as they would shun the leprosy.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the use of language there is perhaps no error
that old and young are more ready to pass over lightly
in themselves than hasty, impatient speech. They
think it a sufficient excuse to plead, “I was off my
guard, and did not really mean what I said.” But
God’s word does not treat it lightly. The Scripture
says:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hasty Speech</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there
is more hope of a fool than of him.”<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c015'><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a
city that is broken down, and without walls.”<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c015'><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In one moment, by the hasty, passionate, careless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>tongue, may be wrought evil that a whole lifetime’s
repentance can not undo. Oh, the hearts that are
broken, the friends estranged, the lives wrecked, by
the harsh, hasty words of those who might have
brought help and healing!</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is that speaketh like the piercings of a
sword; but the tongue of the wise is health.”<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c015'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cherish Self-Forgetfulness</i></div>

<p class='c014'>One of the characteristics that should be especially
cherished and cultivated in every child is that self-forgetfulness
which imparts to the life such an unconscious
grace. Of all excellences of character this is
one of the most beautiful, and for every true life-work
it is one of the qualifications most essential.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Humility; Dignity</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Children need appreciation, sympathy, and encouragement,
but care should be taken not to foster in
them a love of praise. It is not wise to give them
special notice, or to repeat before them their clever
sayings. The parent or teacher who keeps in view the
true ideal of character and the possibilities of achievement,
can not cherish or encourage self-sufficiency.
He will not encourage in the youth the desire or
effort to display their ability or proficiency. He who
looks higher than himself will be humble; yet he will
possess a dignity that is not abashed or disconcerted
by outward display or human greatness.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not by arbitrary law or rule that the graces
of character are developed. It is by dwelling in the
atmosphere of the pure, the noble, the true. And
wherever there is purity of heart and nobleness of
character, it will be revealed in purity and nobleness
of action and of speech.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace
of his lips the King shall be his friend.”<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c015'><sup>[351]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>As with language, so with every other study; it
may be so conducted that it will tend to the strengthening
and upbuilding of character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>History</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Of no study is this true to a greater degree than of
history. Let it be considered from the divine point
of view.</p>

<p class='c014'>As too often taught, history is little more than a
record of the rise and fall of kings, the intrigues of
courts, the victories and defeats of armies,—a story of
ambition and greed, of deception, cruelty, and bloodshed.
Thus taught, its results can not but be detrimental.
The heart-sickening reiteration of crimes and
atrocities, the enormities, the cruelties portrayed, plant
seeds that in many lives bring forth fruit in a harvest
of evil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>From the Divine Point of View</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Far better is it to learn, in the light of God’s word,
the causes that govern the rise and fall of kingdoms.
Let the youth study these records, and see how the
true prosperity of nations has been bound up with an
acceptance of the divine principles. Let him study the
history of the great reformatory movements, and see
how often these principles, though despised and hated,
their advocates brought to the dungeon and the scaffold,
have through these very sacrifices triumphed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such study will give broad, comprehensive views of
life. It will help the youth to understand something
of its relations and dependencies, how wonderfully we
are bound together in the great brotherhood of society
and nations, and to how great an extent the oppression
or degradation of one member means loss to all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Accounts</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Useful Training</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the study of figures the work should be made
practical. Let every youth and every child be taught,
not merely to solve imaginary problems, but to keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>an accurate account of his own income and outgoes.
Let him learn the right use of money by using it.
Whether supplied by their parents or by their own
earnings, let boys and girls learn to select and purchase
their own clothing, their books, and other necessities;
and by keeping an account of their expenses
they will learn, as they could learn in no other way,
the value and the use of money. This training will
help them to distinguish true economy from niggardliness
on the one hand and prodigality on the other.
Rightly directed it will encourage habits of benevolence.
It will aid the youth in learning to give, not
from the mere impulse of the moment, as their feelings
are stirred, but regularly and systematically.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this way every study may become an aid in the
solution of that greatest of all problems, the training
of men and women for the best discharge of life’s
responsibilities.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'><i>Deportment</i></h3>

      <div class='line'><span class='small'>“LOVE DOTH NOT BEHAVE</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Courtesy</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The value of courtesy is too little appreciated.
Many who are kind at heart lack kindliness of
manner. Many who command respect by their sincerity
and uprightness are sadly deficient in geniality.
This lack mars their own happiness, and detracts from
their service to others. Many of life’s sweetest and
most helpful experiences are, often for mere want of
thought, sacrificed by the uncourteous.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cheerfulness and courtesy should especially be cultivated
by parents and teachers. All may possess a
cheerful countenance, a gentle voice, a courteous manner,
and these are elements of power. Children are
attracted by a cheerful, sunny demeanor. Show them
kindness and courtesy, and they will manifest the same
spirit toward you and toward one another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rules of Etiquette</i></div>

<p class='c014'>True courtesy is not learned by the mere practise
of rules of etiquette. Propriety of deportment is at all
times to be observed; wherever principle is not compromised,
consideration of others will lead to compliance
with accepted customs; but true courtesy requires no
sacrifice of principle to conventionality. It ignores
caste. It teaches self-respect, respect for the dignity
of man as man, a regard for every member of the
great human brotherhood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Overestimating Conventionalities</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>There is danger of placing too high a value upon
mere manner and form, and devoting too much time to
education in these lines. The life of strenuous effort
demanded of every youth, the hard, often uncongenial
work required even for life’s ordinary duties, and much
more for lightening the world’s heavy burden of ignorance
and wretchedness,—these give little place for
conventionalities.</p>

<p class='c014'>Many who lay great stress upon etiquette show little
respect for anything, however excellent, that fails of
meeting their artificial standard. This is false education.
It fosters critical pride and narrow exclusiveness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Consideration for Others</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The essence of true politeness is consideration for
others. The essential, enduring education is that which
broadens the sympathies and encourages universal kindliness.
That so-called culture which does not make a
youth deferential toward his parents, appreciative of
their excellences, forbearing toward their defects, and
helpful to their necessities; which does not make him
considerate and tender, generous and helpful toward
the young, the old, and the unfortunate, and courteous
toward all, is a failure.</p>

<p class='c014'>Real refinement of thought and manner is better
learned in the school of the divine Teacher than by
any observance of set rules. His love pervading the
heart gives to the character those refining touches that
fashion it in the semblance of His own. This education
imparts a heaven-born dignity and sense of propriety.
It gives a sweetness of disposition and a gentleness of
manner that can never be equaled by the superficial
polish of fashionable society.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bible enjoins courtesy, and it presents many
illustrations of the unselfish spirit, the gentle grace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the winsome temper, that characterize true politeness.
These are but reflections of the character of Christ.
All the real tenderness and courtesy in the world, even
among those who do not acknowledge His name, is
from Him. And He desires these characteristics to be
perfectly reflected in His children. It is His purpose
that in us men shall behold His beauty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Best Treatise on Etiquette</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The most valuable treatise on etiquette ever penned
is the precious instruction given by the Saviour, with the
utterance of the Holy Spirit through the apostle Paul,—words
that should be ineffaceably written in the memory
of every human being, young or old:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“As I have loved you, that ye also love one
another.”<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c015'><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Reverence</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>For God’s Presence</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Another precious grace that should be carefully
cherished is reverence. True reverence for God is
inspired by a sense of His infinite greatness and a
realization of His presence. With this sense of the
Unseen the heart of every child should be deeply
impressed. The hour and place of prayer and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>services of public worship the child should be taught
to regard as sacred because God is there. And as
reverence is manifested in attitude and demeanor, the
feeling that inspires it will be deepened.</p>

<p class='c014'>Well would it be for young and old to study and
ponder and often repeat those words of Holy Writ
that show how the place marked by God’s special
presence should be regarded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,” He commanded
Moses at the burning bush; “for the place
whereon thou standest is holy ground.”<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c015'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Jacob, after beholding the vision of the angels,
exclaimed, “The Lord is in this place; and I knew it
not.... This is none other but the house of
God, and this is the gate of heaven.”<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c015'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“The Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth
keep silence before Him.”<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c015'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Lord is a great God,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a great King above all gods....</div>
      <div class='line'>O come, let us worship and bow down;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves;</div>
      <div class='line'>We are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.</div>
      <div class='line'>Enter into His gates with thanksgiving,</div>
      <div class='line'>And into His courts with praise;</div>
      <div class='line'>Be thankful unto Him, and bless His name.”<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c015'><sup>[357]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>For His Name</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Reverence should be shown also for the name of
God. Never should that name be spoken lightly or
thoughtlessly. Even in prayer its frequent or needless
repetition should be avoided. “Holy and reverend is
His name.”<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c015'><sup>[358]</sup></a> Angels, as they speak it, veil their faces.
With what reverence should we, who are fallen and
sinful, take it upon our lips!</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Reverence for God’s Word</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>We should reverence God’s word. For the printed
volume we should show respect, never putting it to
common uses, or handling it carelessly. And never
should Scripture be quoted in a jest, or paraphrased
to point a witty saying. “Every word of God is
pure;” “as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified
seven times.”<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c015'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Above all, let children be taught that true reverence
is shown by obedience. God has commanded nothing
that is unessential, and there is no other way of manifesting
reverence so pleasing to Him as obedience to
that which He has spoken.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Respect for Superiors</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Reverence should be shown for God’s representatives,—for
ministers, teachers, and parents who are
called to speak and act in His stead. In the respect
shown to them He is honored.</p>

<p class='c014'>And God has especially enjoined tender respect
toward the aged. He says, “The hoary head is a
crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.”<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c015'><sup>[360]</sup></a>
It tells of battles fought, and victories gained;
of burdens borne, and temptations resisted. It tells of
weary feet nearing their rest, of places soon to be
vacant. Help the children to think of this, and they
will smooth the path of the aged by their courtesy
and respect, and will bring grace and beauty into their
young lives as they heed the command to “rise up
before the hoary head, and honor the face of the
old man.”<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c015'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>Fathers and mothers and teachers need to appreciate
more fully the responsibility and honor that God has
placed upon them, in making them, to the child, the
representatives of Himself. The character revealed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>the contact of daily life will interpret to the child, for
good or for evil, those words of God:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Interpreters of God</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord
pitieth them that fear Him.”<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c015'><sup>[362]</sup></a> “As one whom his
mother comforteth, so will I comfort you.”<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c015'><sup>[363]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Happy the child in whom such words as these
awaken love and gratitude and trust; the child to
whom the tenderness and justice and long-suffering
of father and mother and teacher interpret the love
and justice and long-suffering of God; the child who
by trust and submission and reverence toward his
earthly protectors learns to trust and obey and reverence
his God. He who imparts to child or pupil such
a gift has endowed him with a treasure more precious
than the wealth of all the ages,—a treasure as enduring
as eternity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Teacher’s Rival</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>No education can be complete that does not teach
right principles in regard to dress. Without such
teaching, the work of education is too often retarded
and perverted. Love of dress, and devotion to fashion,
are among the teacher’s most formidable rivals and most
effective hindrances.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Burden in the Home</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Fashion is a mistress that rules with an iron hand.
In very many homes the strength and time and attention
of parents and children are absorbed in meeting her
demands. The rich are ambitious to outdo one another
in conforming to her ever-varying styles; the middle
and poorer classes strive to approach the standard set
by those supposed to be above them. Where means
or strength is limited, and the ambition for gentility
is great, the burden becomes almost insupportable.</p>

<p class='c014'>With many it matters not how becoming, or even
beautiful, a garment may be, let the fashions change,
and it must be remade or cast aside. The members of
the household are doomed to ceaseless toil. There is
no time for training the children, no time for prayer or
Bible study, no time for helping the little ones to become
acquainted with God through His works.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>There is no time and no money for charity. And
often the home table is stinted. The food is ill selected
and hastily prepared, and the demands of nature are
but partially supplied. The result is wrong habits of
diet, which create disease or lead to intemperance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Source of Temptation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The love of display produces extravagance, and in
many young people kills the aspiration for a nobler
life. Instead of seeking an education, they early engage
in some occupation to earn money for indulging the
passion for dress. And through this passion many a
young girl is beguiled to ruin.</p>

<p class='c014'>In many a home the family resources are overtaxed.
The father, unable to supply the demands of the mother
and the children, is tempted to dishonesty, and again
dishonor and ruin are the result.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Fashion and Public Worship</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Even the day and the services of worship are not
exempt from fashion’s domination. Rather they afford
opportunity for the greater display of her power. The
church is made a parade-ground, and the fashions are
studied more than the sermon. The poor, unable to
meet the demands of custom, stay away from church
altogether. The day of rest is spent in idleness, and
by the youth often in associations that are demoralizing.</p>

<p class='c014'>At school, the girls are by unsuitable and uncomfortable
clothing unfitted either for study or for recreation.
Their minds are preoccupied, and the teacher has a
difficult task to awaken their interest.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Counter-Influence</i></div>

<p class='c014'>For breaking the spell of fashion, the teacher can
often find no means more effective than contact with
nature. Let pupils taste the delights to be found by
river or lake or sea; let them climb the hills, gaze on
the sunset glory, explore the treasures of wood and
field; let them learn the pleasure of cultivating plants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>and flowers; and the importance of an additional ribbon
or ruffle will sink into insignificance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Higher Aims</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Lead the youth to see that in dress, as in diet, plain
living is indispensable to high thinking. Lead them to
see how much there is to learn and to do; how precious
are the days of youth as a preparation for the life-work.
Help them to see what treasures there are in the word
of God, in the book of nature, and in the records of
noble lives.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let their minds be directed to the suffering which
they might relieve. Help them to see that by every
dollar squandered in display, the spender is deprived of
means for feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and
comforting the sorrowful.</p>

<p class='c014'>They can not afford to miss life’s glorious opportunities,
to dwarf their minds, to ruin their health, and
to wreck their happiness, for the sake of obedience to
mandates that have no foundation in reason, in comfort,
or in comeliness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Taste and Neatness in Dress</i></div>

<p class='c014'>At the same time the young should be taught to
recognize the lesson of nature, “He hath made everything
beautiful in its time.”<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c015'><sup>[364]</sup></a> In dress, as in all things
else, it is our privilege to honor our Creator. He
desires our clothing to be not only neat and healthful,
but appropriate and becoming.</p>

<p class='c014'>A person’s character is judged by his style of dress.
A refined taste, a cultivated mind, will be revealed in
the choice of simple and appropriate attire. Chaste simplicity
in dress, when united with modesty of demeanor,
will go far toward surrounding a young woman with
that atmosphere of sacred reserve which will be to her
a shield from a thousand perils.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let girls be taught that the art of dressing well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>includes the ability to make their own clothing. This
is an ambition that every girl should cherish. It will
be a means of usefulness and independence that she can
not afford to miss.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Highest Beauty</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is right to love beauty and to desire it; but God
desires us to love and to seek first the highest beauty,—that
which is imperishable. The choicest productions
of human skill possess no beauty that can bear comparison
with that beauty of character which in His sight
is of “great price.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Let the youth and the little children be taught to
choose for themselves that royal robe woven in heaven’s
loom,—the “fine linen, clean and white,”<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c015'><sup>[365]</sup></a> which all the
holy ones of earth will wear. This robe, Christ’s own
spotless character, is freely offered to every human
being. But all who receive it will receive and wear
it here.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let the children be taught that as they open their
minds to pure, loving thoughts and do loving and
helpful deeds, they are clothing themselves with His
beautiful garment of character. This apparel will make
them beautiful and beloved here, and will hereafter be
their title of admission to the palace of the King. His
promise is,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“They shall walk with Me in white; for they are
worthy.”<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c015'><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Sabbath a Sign</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The value of the Sabbath as a means of education
is beyond estimate. Whatever of ours God claims
from us, He returns again, enriched, transfigured, with
His own glory. The tithe that He claimed from Israel
was devoted to preserving among men, in its glorious
beauty, the pattern of His temple in the heavens, the
token of His presence on the earth. So the portion
of our time which He claims is given again to us,
bearing His name and seal. It is “a sign,” He says,
“between Me and you;&nbsp;...  that ye may know
that I am Jehovah;” because “in six days the Lord
made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,
and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed
the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c015'><sup>[367]</sup></a> The Sabbath is a
sign of creative and redeeming power; it points to God
as the source of life and knowledge; it recalls man’s
primeval glory, and thus witnesses to God’s purpose
to re-create us in His own image.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Family Day</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Sabbath and the family were alike instituted in
Eden, and in God’s purpose they are indissolubly linked
together. On this day more than on any other, it is
possible for us to live the life of Eden. It was God’s
plan for the members of the family to be associated in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>work and study, in worship and recreation, the father
as priest of his household, and both father and mother
as teachers and companions of their children. But the
results of sin, having changed the conditions of life,
to a great degree prevent this association. Often the
father hardly sees the faces of his children throughout
the week. He is almost wholly deprived of opportunity
for companionship or instruction. But God’s love
has set a limit to the demands of toil. Over the Sabbath
He places His merciful hand. In His own day He
preserves for the family opportunity for communion with
Him, with nature, and with one another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Sabbath and Nature</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Since the Sabbath is the memorial of creative power,
it is the day above all others when we should acquaint
ourselves with God through His works.  In the minds
of the children the very thought of the Sabbath should
be bound up with the beauty of natural things. Happy
is the family who can go to the place of worship on
the Sabbath as Jesus and His disciples went to the synagogue,—across
the fields, along the shores of the lake,
or through the groves. Happy the father and mother
who can teach their children God’s written word with
illustrations from the open pages of the book of nature;
who can gather under the green trees, in the fresh, pure
air, to study the word and to sing the praise of the
Father above.</p>

<p class='c014'>By such associations parents may bind their children
to their hearts, and thus to God, by ties that can never

<p class='c014'>As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities
of the Sabbath are invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school
lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at the lesson
scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the next week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review
or illustration during the week. Thus the lesson will
become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be
wholly lost.</p>

<p class='c014'>In listening to the sermon, let parents and children
note the text and the scriptures quoted, and as much
as possible of the line of thought, to repeat to one
another at home. This will go far toward relieving
the weariness with which children so often listen to a
sermon, and it will cultivate in all a habit of attention
and of connected thought.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Great Reward</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>Meditation on the themes thus suggested will open
to the student treasures of which he has never dreamed.
He will prove in his own life the reality of the experience
described in the scripture:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and

<div class='sidenote'><i>What Is Faith?</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Faith is trusting God,—believing that He loves
us, and knows best what is for our good. Thus,
instead of our own, it leads us to choose His way. In
place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place
of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness,
His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are
already His; faith acknowledges His ownership and
accepts its blessing. Truth, uprightness, purity, have
been pointed out as secrets of life’s success. It is faith
that puts us in possession of these principles.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every good impulse or aspiration is the gift of God;
faith receives from God the life that alone can produce
true growth and efficiency.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>How to Exercise Faith</i></div>

<p class='c014'>How to exercise faith should be made very plain.
To every promise of God there are conditions. If we
are willing to do His will, all His strength is ours.
Whatever gift He promises, is in the promise itself.
“The seed is the word of God.”<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c015'><sup>[370]</sup></a> As surely as the
oak is in the acorn, so surely is the gift of God in His
promise. If we receive the promise, we have the gift.</p>

<p class='c014'>Faith that enables us to receive God’s gifts is itself
a gift, of which some measure is imparted to every
human being. It grows as exercised in appropriating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the word of God. In order to strengthen faith, we must
often bring it in contact with the word.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Power of God’s Word</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the study of the Bible the student should be led
to see the power of God’s word. In the creation, “He
spake, and it was; He commanded, and it stood fast.”
He “calleth those things which be not as though they
were;”<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c015'><sup>[371]</sup></a> for when He calls them, they are.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Results of Faith</i></div>

<p class='c014'>How often those who trusted the word of God,
though in themselves utterly helpless, have withstood
the power of the whole world,—Enoch, pure in heart,
holy in life, holding fast his faith in the triumph of
righteousness against a corrupt and scoffing generation;
Noah and his household against the men of his
time, men of the greatest physical and mental strength
and the most debased in morals; the children of Israel
at the Red Sea, a helpless, terrified multitude of slaves,
against the mightiest army of the mightiest nation on
the globe; David, a shepherd lad, having God’s promise
of the throne, against Saul, the established monarch, bent
on holding fast his power; Shadrach and his companions
in the fire, and Nebuchadnezzar on the throne; Daniel
among the lions, his enemies in the high places of the
kingdom; Jesus on the cross, and the Jewish priests and
rulers forcing even the Roman governor to work their
will; Paul in chains led to a criminal’s death, Nero the
despot of a world-empire.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such examples are not found in the Bible only.
They abound in every record of human progress. The
Vaudois and the Huguenots, Wycliffe and Huss, Jerome
and Luther, Tyndale and Knox, Zinzendorf and Wesley,
with multitudes of others, have witnessed to the power of
God’s word against human power and policy in support
of evil. These are the world’s true nobility. This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>its royal line. In this line the youth of to-day are
called to take their places.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>In Daily Life</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Faith is needed in the smaller no less than in the
greater affairs of life. In all our daily interests and
occupations the sustaining strength of God becomes
real to us through an abiding trust.</p>

<p class='c014'>Viewed from its human side, life is to all an untried
path. It is a path in which, as regards our deeper
experiences, we each walk alone. Into our inner life
no other human being can fully enter. As the little
child sets forth on that journey in which, sooner or
later, he must choose his own course, himself deciding
life’s issues for eternity, how earnest should be the effort
to direct his trust to the sure Guide and Helper!</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Shield from Temptation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As a shield from temptation and an inspiration to
purity and truth, no other influence can equal the sense
of God’s presence. “All things are naked and opened
unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.” He
is “of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can not look
on iniquity.”<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c015'><sup>[372]</sup></a> This thought was Joseph’s shield amidst
the corruptions of Egypt. To the allurements of temptation
his answer was steadfast: “How can I do this
great wickedness, and sin against God?”<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c015'><sup>[373]</sup></a> Such a
shield, faith, if cherished, will bring to every soul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>God’s Protecting Presence</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Only the sense of God’s presence can banish the fear
that, for the timid child, would make life a burden. Let
him fix in his memory the promise, “The angel of the
Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and
delivereth them.”<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c015'><sup>[374]</sup></a> Let him read that wonderful story
of Elisha in the mountain city, and, between him and
the hosts of armed foemen, a mighty encircling band
of heavenly angels. Let him read how to Peter, in
prison and condemned to death, God’s angel appeared;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>how, past the armed guards, the massive doors and
great iron gateway with their bolts and bars, the angel
led God’s servant forth in safety. Let him read of that
scene on the sea, when to the tempest-tossed soldiers
and seamen, worn with labor and watching and long
fasting, Paul the prisoner, on his way to trial and execution,
spoke those grand words of courage and hope:
“Be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of any
man’s life among you.... For there stood by
me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom
I serve, saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought
before Cæsar; and, lo, God hath given thee all them
that sail with thee.” In the faith of this promise Paul
assured his companions, “There shall not a hair fall
from the head of any of you.” So it came to pass.
Because there was in that ship one man through whom
God could work, the whole ship-load of heathen soldiers
and sailors was preserved. “They escaped all safe
to land.”<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c015'><sup>[375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>These things were not written merely that we might
read and wonder, but that the same faith which wrought
in God’s servants of old might work in us. In no less
marked a manner than He wrought then will He work
now wherever there are hearts of faith to be channels
of His power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Help for the Self-Distrustful</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Let the self-distrustful, whose lack of self-reliance
leads them to shrink from care and responsibility, be
taught reliance upon God. Thus many a one who
otherwise would be but a cipher in the world, perhaps
only a helpless burden, will be able to say with the
apostle Paul, “I can do all things through Christ
which strengtheneth me.”<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c015'><sup>[376]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Guardian of Right</i></div>

<p class='c014'>For the child also who is quick to resent injuries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>faith has precious lessons. The disposition to resist evil
or to avenge wrong is often prompted by a keen sense of
justice and an active, energetic spirit. Let such a child
be taught that God is the eternal guardian of right.
He has a tender care for the beings whom He has so
loved as to give His dearest Beloved to save. He
will deal with every wrong-doer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of
His eye.”<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c015'><sup>[377]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in
Him; and He shall bring it to pass.... He shall
bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
judgment as the noonday.”<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c015'><sup>[378]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed,
a refuge in times of trouble. And they that know Thy
name will put their trust in Thee; for Thou, Lord, hast
not forsaken them that seek Thee.”<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c015'><sup>[379]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Complete in Christ</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The compassion that God manifests toward us, He
bids us manifest toward others. Let the impulsive,
the self-sufficient, the revengeful, behold the meek and
lowly One, led as a lamb to the slaughter, unretaliating
as a sheep dumb before her shearers. Let them
look upon Him whom our sins have pierced and our
sorrows burdened, and they will learn to endure, to
forbear, and to forgive.</p>

<p class='c014'>Through faith in Christ, every deficiency of character
may be supplied, every defilement cleansed, every fault
corrected, every excellence developed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ye are complete in Him.”<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c015'><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Prayer</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>“Believe That Ye Receive”</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Prayer and faith are closely allied, and they need to
be studied together. In the prayer of faith there is a
divine science; it is a science that every one who would
make his life-work a success must understand. Christ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>says, “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray,
believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c015'><sup>[381]</sup></a>
He makes it plain that our asking must be according to
God’s will; we must ask for the things that He has
promised, and whatever we receive must be used in
doing His will. The conditions met, the promise is
unequivocal.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a
Christlike temper, for wisdom and strength to do His
work, for any gift He has promised, we may ask; then
we are to believe that we receive, and return thanks to
God that we have received.</p>

<p class='c014'>We need look for no outward evidence of the blessing.
The gift is in the promise, and we may go about
our work assured that what God has promised He is
able to perform, and that the gift, which we already
possess, will be realized when we need it most.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Secret Prayer</i></div>

<p class='c014'>To live thus by the word of God means the surrender
to Him of the whole life. There will be felt a
continual sense of need and dependence, a drawing out
of the heart after God. Prayer is a necessity; for it is
the life of the soul. Family prayer, public prayer, have
their place; but it is secret communion with God that
sustains the soul-life.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was in the mount with God that Moses beheld
the pattern of that wonderful building which was to be
the abiding-place of His glory. It is in the mount with
God,—in the secret place of communion,—that we are
to contemplate His glorious ideal for humanity. Thus
we shall be enabled so to fashion our character-building
that to us may be fulfilled His promise, “I will dwell in
them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and
they shall be My people.”<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c015'><sup>[382]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Saviour’s Example</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>It was in hours of solitary prayer that Jesus in His
earth-life received wisdom and power. Let the youth
follow His example in finding at dawn and twilight a
quiet season for communion with their Father in heaven.
And throughout the day let them lift up their hearts
to God. At every step of our way He says, “I
the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand;&nbsp;... fear
not; I will help thee.”<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c015'><sup>[383]</sup></a> Could our children learn
these lessons in the morning of their years, what freshness
and power, what joy and sweetness, would be
brought into their lives!</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Cause of Doubt</i></div>

<p class='c014'>These are lessons that only he who himself has
learned can teach. It is because so many parents and
teachers profess to believe the word of God while their
lives deny its power, that the teaching of Scripture has
no greater effect upon the youth. At times the youth
are brought to feel the power of the word. They see
the preciousness of the love of Christ. They see the
beauty of His character, the possibilities of a life given
to His service. But in contrast they see the life of
those who profess to revere God’s precepts. Of how
many are the words true that were spoken to the
prophet Ezekiel:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Thy people “speak one to another, every one to
his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what
is the word that cometh forth from the Lord. And
they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they
sit before thee as My people, and they hear thy words,
but they will not do them; for with their mouth they
show much love; but their heart goeth after their
covetousness. And, lo, thou art unto them as a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can
play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words;
but they do them not.”<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c015'><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Bible to Shape the Life</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is one thing to treat the Bible as a book of good
moral instruction, to be heeded so far as is consistent
with the spirit of the times and our position in the
world; it is another thing to regard it as it really is,—the
word of the living God,—the word that is our life,
the word that is to mould our actions, our words, and
our thoughts. To hold God’s word as anything less
than this is to reject it. And this rejection by those
who profess to believe it, is foremost among the causes
of skepticism and infidelity in the youth.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Time for Prayer</i></div>

<p class='c014'>An intensity such as never before was seen is taking
possession of the world. In amusement, in moneymaking,
in the contest for power, in the very struggle
for existence, there is a terrible force that engrosses
body and mind and soul. In the midst of this maddening
rush, God is speaking. He bids us come apart
and commune with Him. “Be still, and know that I
am God.”<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c015'><sup>[385]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Many, even in their seasons of devotion, fail of
receiving the blessing of real communion with God.
They are in too great haste. With hurried steps they
press through the circle of Christ’s loving presence,
pausing perhaps a moment within the sacred precincts,
but not waiting for counsel. They have no time to
remain with the divine Teacher. With their burdens
they return to their work.</p>

<p class='c014'>These workers can never attain the highest success
until they learn the secret of strength. They must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>give themselves time to think, to pray, to wait upon
God for a renewal of physical, mental, and spiritual
power. They need the uplifting influence of His Spirit.
Receiving this, they will be quickened by fresh life.
The wearied frame and tired brain will be refreshed,
the burdened heart will be lightened.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Precious Experience</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Not a pause for a moment in His presence, but
personal contact with Christ, to sit down in companionship
with Him,—this is our need. Happy will it be
for the children of our homes and the students of our
schools when parents and teachers shall learn in their
own lives the precious experience pictured in these
words from the Song of Songs:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Definite Aim</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Success in any line demands a definite aim. He
who would achieve true success in life must keep
steadily in view the aim worthy of his endeavor. Such
an aim is set before the youth of to-day. The heaven-appointed
purpose of giving the gospel to the world
in this generation is the noblest that can appeal to
any human being. It opens a field of effort to every
one whose heart Christ has touched.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>God’s Purpose for the Youth</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Individual Responsibility</i></div>

<p class='c014'>God’s purpose for the children growing up beside
our hearths is wider, deeper, higher, than our restricted
vision has comprehended. From the humblest lot
those whom He has seen faithful have in time past
been called to witness for Him in the world’s highest
places. And many a lad of to-day, growing up as did
Daniel in his Judean home, studying God’s word and
His works, and learning the lessons of faithful service,
will yet stand in legislative assemblies, in halls of
justice, or in royal courts, as a witness for the King
of kings. Multitudes will be called to a wider ministry.
The whole world is opening to the gospel. Ethiopia is
stretching out her hands unto God. From Japan and
China and India, from the still-darkened lands of our
own continent, from every quarter of this world of ours,
comes the cry of sin-stricken hearts for a knowledge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>the God of love. Millions upon millions have never so
much as heard of God or of His love revealed in Christ.
It is their right to receive this knowledge. They have
an equal claim with us in the Saviour’s mercy. And it
rests with us who have received the knowledge, with
our children to whom we may impart it, to answer their
cry. To every household and every school, to every
parent, teacher, and child upon whom has shone the
light of the gospel, comes at this crisis the question put
to Esther the queen at that momentous crisis in Israel’s
history, “Who knoweth whether <i>thou</i> art come to the
kingdom for such a time as this?”<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c015'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>God a Sharer in Suffering</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Those who think of the result of hastening or hindering
the gospel think of it in relation to themselves
and to the world. Few think of its relation to God.
Few give thought to the suffering that sin has caused
our Creator. All heaven suffered in Christ’s agony;
but that suffering did not begin or end with His
manifestation in humanity. The cross is a revelation
to our dull senses of the pain that, from its very inception,
sin has brought to the heart of God. Every
departure from the right, every deed of cruelty, every
failure of humanity to reach His ideal, brings grief to
Him. When there came upon Israel the calamities that
were the sure result of separation from God,—subjugation
by their enemies, cruelty, and death,—it is said
that “His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.”
“In all their affliction He was afflicted;&nbsp;... and
He bare them, and carried them all the days of old.”<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c015'><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>When the End Will Come</i></div>

<p class='c014'>His Spirit “maketh intercession for us with groanings
which can not be uttered.” As the “whole creation
groaneth and travaileth together in pain,”<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c015'><sup>[389]</sup></a> the heart
of the infinite Father is pained in sympathy. Our world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>is a vast lazar-house, a scene of misery that we dare not
allow even our thoughts to dwell upon. Did we realize
it as it is, the burden would be too terrible. Yet God
feels it all. In order to destroy sin and its results He
gave His best Beloved, and He has put it in our power,
through co-operation with Him, to bring this scene of
misery to an end. “This gospel of the kingdom shall
be preached in all the world for a witness unto all
nations; and then shall the end come.”<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c015'><sup>[390]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature,”<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c015'><sup>[391]</sup></a> is Christ’s command to His followers.
Not that all are called to be ministers or missionaries in
the ordinary sense of the term; but all may be workers
with Him in giving the “glad tidings” to their fellow-men.
To all, great or small, learned or ignorant, old
or young, the command is given.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mistakes in Education</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In view of this command, can we educate our sons
and daughters for a life of respectable conventionality, a
life professedly Christian, but lacking His self-sacrifice,
a life on which the verdict of Him who is truth must be,
“I know you not”?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Selfish Aim</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Thousands are doing this. They think to secure
for their children the benefits of the gospel, while they
deny its spirit. But this can not be. Those who reject
the privilege of fellowship with Christ in service, reject
the only training that imparts a fitness for participation
with Him in His glory. They reject the training that
in this life gives strength and nobility of character.
Many a father and mother, denying their children to
the cross of Christ, have learned too late that they were
thus giving them over to the enemy of God and man.
They sealed their ruin, not alone for the future but for
the present life. Temptation overcame them. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>grew up a curse to the world, a grief and shame to
those who gave them being.</p>

Life is too generally regarded as made up of
distinct periods, the period of learning and the period of
doing,—of preparation and of achievement. In preparation
for a life of service the youth are sent to school,
to acquire knowledge by the study of books. Cut off
from the responsibilities of every-day life, they become
absorbed in study, and often lose sight of its purpose.
The ardor of their early consecration dies out, and too
many take up with some personal, selfish ambition.
Upon their graduation, thousands find themselves out
of touch with life. They have so long dealt with the
abstract and theoretical that when the whole being must
be roused to meet the sharp contests of real life, they
are unprepared. Instead of the noble work they had
purposed, their energies are engrossed in a struggle for
mere subsistence. After repeated disappointments, in
despair even of earning an honest livelihood, many drift
into questionable or criminal practises. The world is
robbed of the service it might have received; and God
is robbed of the souls He longed to uplift, ennoble, and
honor as representatives of Himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Many parents err in discriminating between their
children in the matter of education. They make
almost any sacrifice to secure the best advantages for
one that is bright and apt. But these opportunities
are not thought a necessity for those who are less
promising. Little education is deemed essential for
the performance of life’s ordinary duties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Whom Shall We Educate?</i></div>

<p class='c014'>But who is capable of selecting from a family of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>children the ones upon whom will rest the most important
responsibilities? How often human judgment has
here proved to be at fault! Remember the experience
of Samuel when sent to anoint from the sons of Jesse
one to be king over Israel. Seven noble-looking youth
passed before him. As he looked upon the first, in
features comely, in form well-developed, and in bearing
princely, the prophet exclaimed, “Surely the Lord’s
anointed is before Him.” But God said, “Look not
on his countenance, or on the height of his stature;
because I have refused him; for the Lord seeth not as
man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance,
but the Lord looketh on the heart.” So of all the
seven the testimony was, “The Lord hath not chosen
these.”<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c015'><sup>[392]</sup></a> And not until David had been called from the
flock was the prophet permitted to fulfil his mission.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Not as Man Seeth</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>The elder brothers, from whom Samuel would have
chosen, did not possess the qualifications that God saw
to be essential in a ruler of His people. Proud, self-centered,
self-confident, they were set aside for the one
whom they lightly regarded, one who had preserved the
simplicity and sincerity of his youth, and who, while
little in his own sight, could be trained by God for the
responsibilities of the kingdom. So to-day, in many
a child whom the parents would pass by, God sees
capabilities far above those revealed by others who
are thought to possess great promise.</p>

<p class='c014'>And as regards life’s possibilities, who is capable of
deciding what is great and what is small? How many
a worker in the lowly places of life, by setting on foot
agencies for the blessing of the world, has achieved
results that kings might envy!</p>

<p class='c014'>Let every child, then, receive an education for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>highest service. “In the morning sow thy seed, and in
the evening withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest
not which shall prosper, whether this or that.”<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c015'><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Choosing an Occupation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The specific place appointed us in life is determined
by our capabilities. Not all reach the same development
or do with equal efficiency the same work. God
does not expect the hyssop to attain the proportions
of the cedar, or the olive the height of the stately palm.
But each should aim just as high as the union of human
with divine power makes it possible for him to reach.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cause of Failure</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Many do not become what they might, because they
do not put forth the power that is in them. They do
not, as they might, lay hold on divine strength. Many
are diverted from the line in which they might reach
the truest success. Seeking greater honor or a more
pleasing task, they attempt something for which they are
not fitted. Many a man whose talents are adapted for
some other calling, is ambitious to enter a profession;
and he who might have been successful as a farmer, an
artisan, or a nurse, fills inadequately the position of a
minister, a lawyer, or a physician. There are others,
again, who might have filled a responsible calling, but
who, for want of energy, application, or perseverance,
content themselves with an easier place.</p>

<p class='c014'>We need to follow more closely God’s plan of life.
To do our best in the work that lies nearest, to commit
our ways to God, and to watch for the indications
of His providence,—these are rules that insure safe
guidance in the choice of an occupation.</p>

<p class='c014'>He who came from heaven to be our example spent
nearly thirty years of His life in common, mechanical
labor; but during this time He was studying the word
and the works of God, and helping, teaching, all whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>His influence could reach. When His public ministry
began, He went about healing the sick, comforting the
sorrowful, and preaching the gospel to the poor. This
is the work of all His followers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Example in Service</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“He that is greatest among you,” He said, “let
him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that
doth serve. For&nbsp;... I am among you as he that
serveth.”<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c015'><sup>[394]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Love and loyalty to Christ are the spring of all true
service. In the heart touched by His love, there is
begotten a desire to work for Him. Let this desire be
encouraged and rightly guided. Whether in the home,
the neighborhood, or the school, the presence of the
poor, the afflicted, the ignorant, or the unfortunate,
should be regarded, not as a misfortune, but as affording
precious opportunity for service.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this work, as in every other, skill is gained in
the work itself. It is by training in the common duties
of life and in ministry to the needy and suffering,
that efficiency is assured. Without this the best-meant
efforts are often useless and even harmful. It is in the
water, not on the land, that men learn to swim.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Church Relationship</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Another obligation, too often lightly regarded,—one
that to the youth awakened to the claims of Christ
needs to be made plain,—is the obligation of church
relationship.</p>

<p class='c014'>Very close and sacred is the relation between Christ
and His church,—He the bridegroom, and the church
the bride; He the head, and the church the body.
Connection with Christ, then, involves connection with
His church.</p>

<p class='c014'>The church is organized for service; and in a life of
service to Christ, connection with the church is one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>the first steps. Loyalty to Christ demands the faithful
performance of church duties. This is an important
part of one’s training; and in a church imbued with
the Master’s life, it will lead directly to effort for the
world without.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Young People’s Societies</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There are many lines in which the youth can find
opportunity for helpful effort. Let them organize into
bands for Christian service, and the co-operation will
prove an assistance and an encouragement. Parents
and teachers, by taking an interest in the work of the
young people, will be able to give them the benefit of
their own larger experience, and can help them to make
their efforts effective for good.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Foreign Missions</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It is acquaintance that awakens sympathy, and sympathy
is the spring of effective ministry. To awaken
in the children and youth sympathy and the spirit of
sacrifice for the suffering millions in the “regions
beyond,” let them become acquainted with these lands
and their peoples. In this line much might be accomplished
in our schools. Instead of dwelling on the
exploits of the Alexanders and Napoleons of history,
let the pupils study the lives of such men as the apostle
Paul and Martin Luther, as Moffat and Livingstone and
Carey, and the present daily-unfolding history of missionary
effort. Instead of burdening their memories
with an array of names and theories that have no
bearing upon their lives, and to which, once outside
the schoolroom, they rarely give a thought, let them
study all lands in the light of missionary effort, and
become acquainted with the peoples and their needs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Workers from the Common People</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In this closing work of the gospel there is a vast
field to be occupied; and, more than ever before, the
work is to enlist helpers from the common people.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Both the youth and those older in years will be called
from the field, from the vineyard, and from the workshop,
and sent forth by the Master to give His message.
Many of these have had little opportunity for education;
but Christ sees in them qualifications that will enable
them to fulfil His purpose. If they put their hearts
into the work, and continue to be learners, He will fit
them to labor for Him.</p>

<p class='c014'>He who knows the depths of the world’s misery
and despair, knows by what means to bring relief. He
sees on every hand souls in darkness, bowed down with
sin and sorrow and pain. But He sees also their possibilities;
He sees the height to which they may attain.
Although human beings have abused their mercies,
wasted their talents, and lost the dignity of godlike manhood,
the Creator is to be glorified in their redemption.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Saviour’s Choice</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The burden of labor for these needy ones in the
rough places of the earth Christ lays upon those who
can feel for the ignorant and for such as are out of
the way. He will be present to help those whose
hearts are susceptible to pity, though their hands may
be rough and unskilled. He will work through those
who can see mercy in misery, and gain in loss. When
the Light of the world passes by, privilege will be
discerned in hardship, order in confusion, success in
apparent failure. Calamities will be seen as disguised
blessings; woes, as mercies. Laborers from the common
people, sharing the sorrows of their fellow-men as
their Master shared the sorrows of the whole human
race, will by faith see Him working with them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and
hasteth greatly.”<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c015'><sup>[395]</sup></a> And a world is to be warned.</p>

<p class='c014'>With such preparation as they can gain, thousands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>upon thousands of the youth and those older in years
should be giving themselves to this work. Already
many hearts are responding to the call of the Master
Worker, and their numbers will increase. Let every
Christian educator give such workers sympathy and
co-operation. Let him encourage and assist the youth
under his care in gaining a preparation to join the ranks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Opportunity for Education</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There is no line of work in which it is possible for
the youth to receive greater benefit. All who engage
in ministry are God’s helping hand. They are co-workers
with the angels; rather, they are the human
agencies through whom the angels accomplish their
mission. Angels speak through their voices, and work
by their hands. And the human workers, co-operating
with heavenly agencies, have the benefit of their education
and experience. As a means of education, what
“university course” can equal this?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Our Children’s Heritage</i></div>

<p class='c014'>With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly
trained, might furnish, how soon the message of a
crucified, risen, and soon-coming Saviour might be
carried to the whole world! How soon might the
end come,—the end of suffering and sorrow and sin!
How soon, in place of a possession here, with its blight
of sin and pain, our children might receive their inheritance
where “the righteous shall inherit the land, and
dwell therein forever;” where “the inhabitant shall not
say, I am sick,” and “the voice of weeping shall be no
more heard.”<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c015'><sup>[396]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Mother’s Opportunity</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The child’s first teacher is the mother. During
the period of greatest susceptibility and most rapid
development his education is to a great degree in her
hands. To her first is given opportunity to mould the
character for good or for evil. She should understand
the value of her opportunity, and, above every other
teacher, should be qualified to use it to the best account.
Yet there is no other to whose training so little thought
is given. The one whose influence in education is most
potent and far-reaching is the one for whose assistance
there is the least systematic effort.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lack of Preparation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Those to whom the care of the little child is committed
are too often ignorant of its physical needs;
they know little of the laws of health or the principles
of development. Nor are they better fitted to care for
its mental and spiritual growth. They may be qualified
to conduct business or to shine in society; they may
have made creditable attainments in literature and science;
but of the training of a child they have little
knowledge. It is chiefly because of this lack, especially
because of the early neglect of physical development,
that so large a proportion of the human race die in
infancy, and of those who reach maturity there are so
many to whom life is but a burden.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Education for Parents</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Upon fathers as well as mothers rests a responsibility
for the child’s earlier as well as its later training,
and for both parents the demand for careful and thorough
preparation is most urgent. Before taking upon
themselves the possibilities of fatherhood and motherhood,
men and women should become acquainted with
the laws of physical development,—with physiology and
hygiene, with the bearing of prenatal influences, with the
laws of heredity, sanitation, dress, exercise, and the treatment
of disease; they should also understand the laws
of mental development and moral training.</p>

<p class='c014'>This work of education the Infinite One has counted
so important that messengers from His throne have
been sent to a mother that was to be, to answer the
question, “How shall we order the child, and how shall
we do unto him?”<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c015'><sup>[397]</sup></a> and to instruct a father concerning
the education of a promised son.</p>

<p class='c014'>Never will education accomplish all that it might
and should accomplish until the importance of the
parents’ work is fully recognized, and they receive a
training for its sacred responsibilities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Teacher; Broad Training</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The necessity of preparatory training for the teacher
is universally admitted; but few recognize the character
of the preparation most essential. He who appreciates
the responsibility involved in the training of the youth,
will realize that instruction in scientific and literary lines
alone can not suffice. The teacher should have a more
comprehensive education than can be gained by the
study of books. He should possess not only strength
but breadth of mind; should be not only whole-souled
but large-hearted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Essential Qualifications</i></div>

<p class='c014'>He only who created the mind and ordained its
laws can perfectly understand its needs or direct its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>development. The principles of education that He has
given are the only safe guide. A qualification essential
for every teacher is a knowledge of these principles, and
such an acceptance of them as will make them a controlling
power in his own life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Experience in practical life is indispensable. Order,
thoroughness, punctuality, self-control, a sunny temper,
evenness of disposition, self-sacrifice, integrity, and courtesy
are essential qualifications.</p>

<p class='c014'>Because there is so much cheapness of character,
so much of the counterfeit all around the youth, there
is the more need that the teacher’s words, attitude,
and deportment should represent the elevated and the
true. Children are quick to detect affectation or any
other weakness or defect. The teacher can gain the
respect of his pupils in no other way than by revealing
in his own character the principles which he seeks to
teach them. Only as he does this in his daily association
with them can he have a permanent influence over
them for good.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Physical Vigor</i></div>

<p class='c014'>For almost every other qualification that contributes
to his success, the teacher is in great degree dependent
upon physical vigor. The better his health, the better
will be his work.</p>

<p class='c014'>So wearing are his responsibilities that special effort
on his part is required to preserve vigor and freshness.
Often he becomes heart-weary and brain-weary, with the
almost irresistible tendency to depression, coldness, or
irritability. It is his duty not merely to resist such
moods but to avoid their cause. He needs to keep the
heart pure and sweet and trustful and sympathetic. In
order to be always firm and calm and cheerful, he must
preserve the strength of brain and nerve.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Since in his work quality is so much more important
than quantity, he should guard against overlabor,—against
attempting too much in his own line of duty;
against accepting other responsibilities that would unfit
him for his work; and against engaging in amusements
and social pleasures that are exhausting rather than
recuperative.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Outdoor Labor</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Outdoor exercise, especially in useful labor, is one
of the best means of recreation for body and mind; and
the teacher’s example will inspire his pupils with interest
in and respect for manual labor.</p>

<p class='c014'>In every line the teacher should scrupulously observe
the principles of health. He should do this not only
because of its bearing upon his own usefulness, but also
because of its influence upon his pupils. He should be
temperate in all things; in diet, dress, labor, recreation,
he is to be an example.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Literary Attainments</i></div>

<p class='c014'>With physical health and uprightness of character
should be combined high literary qualifications. The
more of true knowledge the teacher has, the better will
be his work. The schoolroom is no place for surface-work.
No teacher who is satisfied with superficial
knowledge will attain a high degree of efficiency.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A High Standard</i></div>

<p class='c014'>But the teacher’s usefulness depends not so much
upon the actual amount of his acquirements as upon
the standard at which he aims. The true teacher is
not content with dull thoughts, an indolent mind, or a
loose memory. He constantly seeks higher attainments
and better methods. His life is one of continual growth.
In the work of such a teacher there is a freshness, a
quickening power, that awakens and inspires his pupils.</p>

<p class='c014'>The teacher must have aptness for his work. He
must have the wisdom and tact required in dealing with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>minds. However great his scientific knowledge, however
excellent his qualifications in other lines, if he
does not gain the respect and confidence of his pupils,
his efforts will be in vain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Administrative Ability</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Teachers are needed who are quick to discern and
improve every opportunity for doing good; those who
with enthusiasm combine true dignity; who are able to
control, and “apt to teach;” who can inspire thought,
arouse energy, and impart courage and life.</p>

<p class='c014'>A teacher’s advantages may have been limited, so
that he may not possess as high literary qualifications
as might be desirable; yet if he has true insight into
human nature; if he has a genuine love for his work,
an appreciation of its magnitude, and a determination to
improve; if he is willing to labor earnestly and perseveringly,
he will comprehend the needs of his pupils, and,
by his sympathetic, progressive spirit, will inspire them
to follow as he seeks to lead them onward and upward.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Difficulties</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sympathy and Insight</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The children and youth under the teacher’s care
differ widely in disposition, habits, and training. Some
have no definite purpose or fixed principles. They need
to be awakened to their responsibilities and possibilities.
Few children have been rightly trained at home. Some
have been household pets. Their whole training has
been superficial. Allowed to follow inclination and to
shun responsibility and burden-bearing, they lack stability,
perseverance, and self-denial. These often regard
all discipline as an unnecessary restraint. Others have
been censured and discouraged. Arbitrary restraint
and harshness have developed in them obstinacy and
defiance. If these deformed characters are reshaped,
the work must, in most cases, be done by the teacher.
In order to accomplish it successfully, he must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the sympathy and insight that will enable him to trace
to their cause the faults and errors manifest in his pupils.
He must have also the tact and skill, the patience and
firmness, that will enable him to impart to each the
needed help,—to the vacillating and ease-loving, such
encouragement and assistance as will be a stimulus to
exertion; to the discouraged, sympathy and appreciation
that will create confidence and thus inspire effort.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Social Relation</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Teachers often fail of coming sufficiently into social
relation with their pupils. They manifest too little
sympathy and tenderness, and too much of the dignity
of the stern judge. While the teacher must be firm
and decided, he should not be exacting or dictatorial.
To be harsh and censorious, to stand aloof from his
pupils or treat them indifferently, is to close the
avenues through which he might influence them for
good.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Partiality</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Under no circumstances should the teacher manifest
partiality. To favor the winning, attractive pupil, and
be critical, impatient, or unsympathetic toward those who
most need encouragement and help, is to reveal a total
misconception of the teacher’s work. It is in dealing
with the faulty, trying ones that the character is tested,
and it is proved whether the teacher is really qualified
for his position.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Responsibility</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Great is the responsibility of those who take upon
themselves the guidance of a human soul. The true
father and mother count theirs a trust from which they
can never be wholly released. The life of the child,
from his earliest to his latest day, feels the power of
that tie which binds him to the parent’s heart; the
acts, the words, the very look of the parent, continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>to mould the child for good or for evil. The teacher
shares this responsibility, and he needs constantly to
realize its sacredness, and to keep in view the purpose
of his work. He is not merely to accomplish the daily
tasks, to please his employers, to maintain the standing
of the school; he must consider the highest good of
his pupils as individuals, the duties that life will lay
upon them, the service it requires, and the preparation
demanded. The work he is doing day by day will
exert upon his pupils, and through them upon others,
an influence that will not cease to extend and strengthen
until time shall end. The fruits of his work he must
meet in that great day when every word and deed shall
be brought in review before God.</p>

<p class='c014'>The teacher who realizes this will not feel that his
work is completed when he has finished the daily routine
of recitations, and for a time his pupils pass from
under his direct care. He will carry these children
and youth upon his heart. How to secure for them
the noblest standard of attainment will be his constant
study and effort.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Self-Improvement</i></div>

<p class='c014'>He who discerns the opportunities and privileges of
his work will allow nothing to stand in the way of
earnest endeavor for self-improvement. He will spare
no pains to reach the highest standard of excellence.
All that he desires his pupils to become, he will himself
strive to be.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>The deeper the sense of responsibility, and the more
earnest the effort for self-improvement, the more clearly
will the teacher perceive and the more keenly regret the
defects that hinder his usefulness. As he beholds the
magnitude of his work, its difficulties and possibilities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>often will his heart cry out, “Who is sufficient for
these things?”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Our Source of Help</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Dear teacher, as you consider your need of strength
and guidance,—need that no human source can supply,—I
bid you consider the promises of Him who is
the wonderful Counselor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Behold,” He says, “I have set before thee an open

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>In the formation of character, no other influences
count so much as the influence of the home. The
teacher’s work should supplement that of the parents,
but is not to take its place. In all that concerns the
well-being of the child, it should be the effort of parents
and teachers to co-operate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Co-operation of Parents</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The work of co-operation should begin with the
father and mother themselves, in the home life. In the
training of their children they have a joint responsibility,
and it should be their constant endeavor to act
together. Let them yield themselves to God, seeking
help from Him to sustain each other. Let them teach
their children to be true to God, true to principle, and
thus true to themselves and to all with whom they are
connected. With such training, children when sent to
school will not be a cause of disturbance or anxiety.
They will be a support to their teachers, and an example
and encouragement to their fellow-pupils.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sustaining the Teacher</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Parents who give this training are not the ones likely
to be found criticizing the teacher. They feel that both
the interest of their children and justice to the school
demand that, so far as possible, they sustain and honor
the one who shares their responsibility.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Criticism</i></div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Many parents fail here. By their hasty, unfounded
criticism the influence of the faithful, self-sacrificing
teacher is often well-nigh destroyed. Many parents
whose children have been spoiled by indulgence, leave
to the teacher the unpleasant task of repairing their
neglect; and then by their own course they make his
task almost hopeless. Their criticism and censure of
the school management encourage insubordination in
the children, and confirm them in wrong habits.</p>

<p class='c014'>If criticism or suggestion in regard to the teacher’s
work becomes necessary, it should be made to him in
private. If this proves ineffective, let the matter be
referred to those who are responsible for the management
of the school. Nothing should be said or done
to weaken the children’s respect for the one upon whom
their well-being in so great degree depends.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Acquaintance with the Teacher</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The parents’ intimate knowledge both of the character
of the children and of their physical peculiarities
or infirmities, if imparted to the teacher, would be an
assistance to him. It is to be regretted that so many
fail of realizing this. By most parents little interest is
shown either to inform themselves as to the teacher’s
qualifications, or to co-operate with him in his work.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Teacher’s Aid to Parents</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Since parents so rarely acquaint themselves with
the teacher, it is the more important that the teacher
seek the acquaintance of parents. He should visit the
homes of his pupils, and gain a knowledge of the influences
and surroundings among which they live. By
coming personally in touch with their homes and lives,
he may strengthen the ties that bind him to his pupils,
and may learn how to deal more successfully with their
different dispositions and temperaments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Double Benefit</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As he interests himself in the home education,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>the teacher imparts a double benefit. Many parents,
absorbed in work and care, lose sight of their opportunities
to influence for good the lives of their children.
The teacher can do much to arouse these parents to
their possibilities and privileges. He will find others
to whom the sense of their responsibility is a heavy
burden, so anxious are they that their children shall
become good and useful men and women. Often the
teacher can assist these parents in bearing their burden,
and, by counseling together, both teacher and parents
will be encouraged and strengthened.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Parents and Children</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the home training of the youth, the principle of
co-operation is invaluable. From their earliest years
children should be led to feel that they are a part of
the home firm. Even the little ones should be trained
to share in the daily work, and should be made to
feel that their help is needed and is appreciated. The
older ones should be their parents’ assistants, entering
into their plans, and sharing their responsibilities and
burdens. Let fathers and mothers take time to teach
their children, let them show that they value their help,
desire their confidence, and enjoy their companionship,
and the children will not be slow to respond. Not only
will the parents’ burden be lightened, and the children
receive a practical training of inestimable worth, but
there will be a strengthening of the home ties and a
deepening of the very foundations of character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Teachers and Students</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Co-operation should be the spirit of the schoolroom,
the law of its life. The teacher who gains the
co-operation of his pupils secures an invaluable aid
in maintaining order. In service in the schoolroom
many a boy whose restlessness leads to disorder and
insubordination would find an outlet for his superfluous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>energy. Let the older assist the younger, the strong
the weak; and, so far as possible, let each be called
upon to do something in which he excels. This will
encourage self-respect and a desire to be useful.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Bible Examples</i></div>

<p class='c014'>It would be helpful for the youth, and for parents
and teachers as well, to study the lesson of co-operation
as taught in the Scriptures. Among its many illustrations
notice the building of the tabernacle,—that object-lesson
of character-building,—in which the whole people
united, “every one whose heart stirred him up, and
every one whom his spirit made willing.”<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c015'><sup>[402]</sup></a> Read how
the wall of Jerusalem was rebuilt by the returned captives,
in the midst of poverty, difficulty, and danger,
the great task successfully accomplished because “the
people had a mind to work.”<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c015'><sup>[403]</sup></a> Consider the part acted
by the disciples in the Saviour’s miracle for the feeding
of the multitude. The food multiplied in the hands of
Christ, but the disciples received the loaves, and gave
to the waiting throng.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We are members one of another.” As every one
therefore “hath received a<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c015'><sup>[404]</sup></a> gift, even so minister the
same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold
grace of God.”<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c015'><sup>[405]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Well might the words written of the idol-builders
of old be, with worthier aim, adopted as a motto by
character-builders of to-day:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“They helped every one his neighbor; and every
one said to his brother, Be of good courage.”<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c015'><sup>[406]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Teaching Obedience</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>One of the first lessons a child needs to learn is the
lesson of obedience. Before he is old enough to
reason, he may be taught to obey. By gentle, persistent
effort, the habit should be established. Thus, to a
great degree, may be prevented those later conflicts
between will and authority that do so much to create
alienation and bitterness toward parents and teachers,
and too often resistance of all authority, human and
divine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Self-Government</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The object of discipline is the training of the child
for self-government. He should be taught self-reliance
and self-control. Therefore as soon as he is capable of
understanding, his reason should be enlisted on the side
of obedience. Let all dealing with him be such as to
show obedience to be just and reasonable. Help him
to see that all things are under law, and that disobedience
leads, in the end, to disaster and suffering.
When God says “Thou shalt not,” He in love warns
us of the consequences of disobedience, in order to save
us from harm and loss.</p>

<p class='c014'>Help the child to see that parents and teachers are
representatives of God, and that as they act in harmony
with Him, their laws in the home and the school are
also His. As the child is to render obedience to parents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>and teachers, so they, in turn, are to render obedience
to God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Breaking the Will</i>”</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lack of Moral Stamina</i></div>

<p class='c014'>To direct the child’s development without hindering
it by undue control should be the study of both parent
and teacher. Too much management is as bad as too
little. The effort to “break the will” of a child is a terrible
mistake. Minds are constituted differently; while
force may secure outward submission, the result with
many children is a more determined rebellion of the
heart. Even should the parent or teacher succeed in
gaining the control he seeks, the outcome may be no
less harmful to the child. The discipline of a human
being who has reached the years of intelligence should
differ from the training of a dumb animal. The beast is
taught only submission to its master. For the beast,
the master is mind, judgment, and will. This method,
sometimes employed in the training of children, makes
them little more than automatons. Mind, will, conscience,
are under the control of another. It is not
God’s purpose that any mind should be thus dominated.
Those who weaken or destroy individuality assume a
responsibility that can result only in evil. While under
authority, the children may appear like well-drilled soldiers;
but when the control ceases, the character will be
found to lack strength and steadfastness. Having never
learned to govern himself, the youth recognizes no
restraint except the requirement of parents or teacher.
This removed, he knows not how to use his liberty,
and often gives himself up to indulgence that proves his
ruin.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since the surrender of the will is so much more difficult
for some pupils than for others, the teacher should
make obedience to his requirements as easy as possible.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>The will should be guided and moulded, but not ignored
or crushed. Save the strength of the will; in the battle
of life it will be needed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Value of Will Power</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Every child should understand the true force of the
will. He should be led to see how great is the responsibility
involved in this gift. The will is the governing
power in the nature of man, the power of decision, or
choice. Every human being possessed of reason has
power to choose the right. In every experience of
life, God’s word to us is, “Choose you this day whom
ye will serve.”<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c015'><sup>[407]</sup></a> Every one may place his will on the
side of the will of God, may choose to obey Him, and
by thus linking himself with divine agencies, he may
stand where nothing can force him to do evil. In every
youth, every child, lies the power, by the help of God,
to form a character of integrity and to live a life of
usefulness.</p>

<p class='c014'>The parent or teacher who by such instruction trains
the child to self-control will be the most useful and
permanently successful. To the superficial observer his
work may not appear to the best advantage; it may not
be valued so highly as that of the one who holds the
mind and will of the child under absolute authority;
but after-years will show the result of the better method
of training.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Sense of Honor</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The wise educator, in dealing with his pupils, will
seek to encourage confidence and to strengthen the
sense of honor. Children and youth are benefited by
being trusted. Many, even of the little children, have
a high sense of honor; all desire to be treated with
confidence and respect, and this is their right. They
should not be led to feel that they can not go out or
come in without being watched. Suspicion demoralizes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>producing the very evils it seeks to prevent. Instead of
watching continually, as if suspecting evil, teachers who
are in touch with their pupils will discern the workings
of the restless mind, and will set to work influences that
will counteract evil. Lead the youth to feel that they
are trusted, and there are few who will not seek to
prove themselves worthy of the trust.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Requests; Commands</i></div>

<p class='c014'>On the same principle it is better to request than to
command; the one thus addressed has opportunity to
prove himself loyal to right principles. His obedience
is the result of choice rather than compulsion.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rules governing the schoolroom should, so far
as possible, represent the voice of the school. Every
principle involved in them should be so placed before
the student that he may be convinced of its justice.
Thus he will feel a responsibility to see that the rules
which he himself has helped to frame are obeyed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Enforcing Rules</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Rules should be few and well considered; and when
once made, they should be enforced. Whatever it is
found impossible to change, the mind learns to recognize
and adapt itself to; but the possibility of indulgence
induces desire, hope, and uncertainty, and the results
are restlessness, irritability, and insubordination.</p>

<p class='c014'>It should be made plain that the government of
God knows no compromise with evil. Neither in the
home nor in the school should disobedience be tolerated.
No parent or teacher who has at heart the well-being of
those under his care will compromise with the stubborn
self-will that defies authority or resorts to subterfuge or
evasion in order to escape obedience. It is not love but
sentimentalism that palters with wrong-doing, seeks by
coaxing or bribes to secure compliance, and finally
accepts some substitute in place of the thing required.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“Fools make a mock at sin.”<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c015'><sup>[408]</sup></a> We should beware
of treating sin as a light thing. Terrible is its power
over the wrong-doer. “His own iniquities shall take
the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the
cords of his sins.”<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c015'><sup>[409]</sup></a> The greatest wrong done to a
child or youth is to allow him to become fastened in
the bondage of evil habit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Freedom in Obedience</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The youth have an inborn love of liberty; they
desire freedom; and they need to understand that these
inestimable blessings are to be enjoyed only in obedience
to the law of God. This law is the preserver of
true freedom and liberty. It points out and prohibits
those things that degrade and enslave, and thus to the
obedient it affords protection from the power of evil.</p>

<p class='c014'>The psalmist says: “I will walk at liberty; for I seek
Thy precepts.” “Thy testimonies also are my delight
and my counselors.”<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c015'><sup>[410]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Criticism; Censure</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In our efforts to correct evil, we should guard
against a tendency to faultfinding or censure. Continual
censure bewilders, but does not reform. With
many minds, and often those of the finest susceptibility,
an atmosphere of unsympathetic criticism is fatal
to effort. Flowers do not unfold under the breath of
a blighting wind.</p>

<p class='c014'>A child frequently censured for some special fault,
comes to regard that fault as his peculiarity, something
against which it is vain to strive. Thus are created
discouragement and hopelessness, often concealed under
an appearance of indifference or bravado.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Object of Reproof</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The true object of reproof is gained only when the
wrong-doer himself is led to see his fault, and his will is
enlisted for its correction. When this is accomplished,
point him to the source of pardon and power. Seek to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>preserve his self-respect, and to inspire him with courage
and hope.</p>

<p class='c014'>This work is the nicest, the most difficult, ever committed
to human beings. It requires the most delicate
tact, the finest susceptibility, a knowledge of human
nature, and a heaven-born faith and patience, willing to
work and watch and wait. It is a work than which
nothing can be more important.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Self-Control</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Those who desire to control others must first control
themselves. To deal passionately with a child or youth
will only arouse his resentment. When a parent or
teacher becomes impatient, and is in danger of speaking
unwisely, let him remain silent. There is wonderful
power in silence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sympathy; Forbearance</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The teacher must expect to meet perverse dispositions
and obdurate hearts. But in dealing with them
he should never forget that he himself was once a child,
in need of discipline. Even now, with all his advantages
of age, education, and experience, he often errs,
and is in need of mercy and forbearance. In training
the youth he should consider that he is dealing with
those who have inclinations to evil similar to his own.
They have almost everything to learn, and it is much
more difficult for some to learn than for others. With
the dull pupil he should bear patiently, not censuring
his ignorance, but improving every opportunity to give
him encouragement. With sensitive, nervous pupils
he should deal very tenderly. A sense of his own
imperfections should lead him constantly to manifest
sympathy and forbearance toward those who also are
struggling with difficulties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Saviour’s Rule</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Saviour’s rule,—“As ye would that men should
do to you, do ye also to them likewise,”<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c015'><sup>[411]</sup></a>—should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>the rule of all who undertake the training of children
and youth. They are the younger members of the
Lord’s family, heirs with us of the grace of life.
Christ’s rule should be sacredly observed toward the
dullest, the youngest, the most blundering, and even
toward the erring and rebellious.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Public Discipline</i></div>

<p class='c014'>This rule will lead the teacher to avoid, so far as
possible, making public the faults or errors of a pupil.
He will seek to avoid giving reproof or punishment
in the presence of others. He will not expel a student
until every effort has been put forth for his re-formation.
But when it becomes evident that the student is
receiving no benefit himself, while his defiance or disregard
of authority tends to overthrow the government
of the school, and his influence is contaminating others,
then his expulsion becomes a necessity. Yet with many
the disgrace of public expulsion would lead to utter
recklessness and ruin. In most cases when removal
is unavoidable, the matter need not be made public.
By counsel and co-operation with the parents, let the
teacher privately arrange for the student’s withdrawal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Justice; Compassion</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In this time of special danger for the young, temptations
surround them on every hand; and while it is easy
to drift, the strongest effort is required in order to press
against the current. Every school should be a “city of
refuge” for the tempted youth, a place where their follies
shall be dealt with patiently and wisely. Teachers who
understand their responsibilities will separate from their
own hearts and lives everything that would prevent
them from dealing successfully with the wilful and
disobedient. Love and tenderness, patience and self-control,
will at all times be the law of their speech.
Mercy and compassion will be blended with justice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>When it is necessary to give reproof, their language will
not be exaggerated, but humble. In gentleness they
will set before the wrong-doer his errors, and help him
to recover himself. Every true teacher will feel that
should he err at all, it is better to err on the side of
mercy than on the side of severity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Reclaimed by Kindness</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Many youth who are thought incorrigible are not at
heart so hard as they appear. Many who are regarded
as hopeless may be reclaimed by wise discipline. These
are often the ones who most readily melt under kindness.
Let the teacher gain the confidence of the tempted
one, and by recognizing and developing the good in
his character, he can, in many cases, correct the evil
without calling attention to it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Our Example</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The divine Teacher bears with the erring through
all their perversity. His love does not grow cold; His
efforts to win them do not cease. With outstretched
arms He waits to welcome again and again the erring,
the rebellious, and even the apostate. His heart is
touched with the helplessness of the little child subject
to rough usage. The cry of human suffering never
reaches His ear in vain. Though all are precious
in His sight, the rough, sullen, stubborn dispositions
draw most heavily upon His sympathy and love; for
He traces from cause to effect. The one who is most
easily tempted, and is most inclined to err, is the special
object of His solicitude.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every parent and every teacher should cherish the
attributes of Him who makes the cause of the afflicted,
the suffering, and the tempted His own. He should
be one who can have “compassion on the ignorant, and
on them that are out of the way; for that he himself
also is compassed with infirmity.”<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c015'><sup>[412]</sup></a> Jesus treats us far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>better than we deserve; and as He has treated us, so
we are to treat others. The course of no parent or
teacher is justifiable if it is unlike that which under
similar circumstances the Saviour would pursue.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='sidenote'><i>Meeting Life’s Discipline</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Beyond the discipline of the home and the school,
all have to meet the stern discipline of life. How to
meet this wisely is a lesson that should be made plain
to every child and to every youth. It is true that God
loves us, that He is working for our happiness, and
that, if His law had always been obeyed, we should
never have known suffering; and it is no less true that,
in this world, as the result of sin, suffering, trouble,
burdens, come to every life. We may do the children
and the youth a lifelong good by teaching them to meet
bravely these troubles and burdens. While we should
give them sympathy, let it never be such as to foster
self-pity. What they need is that which stimulates and
strengthens rather than weakens.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Be Strong</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>They should be taught that this world is not a
parade-ground, but a battle-field. All are called to
endure hardness, as good soldiers. They are to be
strong, and quit themselves like men. Let them be
taught that the true test of character is found in the
willingness to bear burdens, to take the hard place, to
do the work that needs to be done, though it bring no
earthly recognition or reward.</p>

<p class='c014'>The true way of dealing with trial is not by seeking
to escape it, but by transforming it. This applies
to all discipline, the earlier as well as the later. The
neglect of the child’s earliest training, and the consequent
strengthening of wrong tendencies, makes his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>after-education more difficult, and causes discipline to
be too often a painful process. Painful it must be to
the lower nature, crossing, as it does, the natural desires
and inclinations; but the pain may be lost sight of in
a higher joy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Stepping-Stones</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Let the child and the youth be taught that every
mistake, every fault, every difficulty, conquered, becomes
a stepping-stone to better and higher things. It is
through such experiences that all who have ever made
life worth the living have achieved success.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Something better” is the watchword of education,
the law of all true living. Whatever Christ asks
us to renounce, He offers in its stead something better.
Often the youth cherish objects, pursuits, and pleasures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>that may not appear to be evil, but that fall short of
the highest good. They divert the life from its noblest
aim. Arbitrary measures or direct denunciation may
not avail in leading these youth to relinquish that which
they hold dear. Let them be directed to something
better than display, ambition, or self-indulgence. Bring
them in contact with truer beauty, with loftier principles,
and with nobler lives. Lead them to behold the One
“altogether lovely.” When once the gaze is fixed upon
Him, the life finds its center. The enthusiasm, the generous
devotion, the passionate ardor of the youth find
here their true object. Duty becomes a delight, and
sacrifice a pleasure. To honor Christ, to become like
Him, to work for Him, is the life’s highest ambition
and its greatest joy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Its Location</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Heaven is a school; its field of study, the universe;
its teacher, the Infinite One. A branch of
this school was established in Eden; and, the plan of
redemption accomplished, education will again be taken
up in the Eden school.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the things which God
hath prepared for them that love Him.”<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c015'><sup>[415]</sup></a> Only through
His word can a knowledge of these things be gained;
and even this affords but a partial revelation.</p>

<p class='c014'>The prophet of Patmos thus describes the location
of the school of the hereafter:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>A New Earth</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>“I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first
heaven and the first earth were passed away....
And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming
down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
adorned for her husband.”<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c015'><sup>[416]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“The city had no need of the sun, neither of the
moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten
it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.”<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c015'><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Conditions</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Between the school established in Eden at the beginning
and the school of the hereafter there lies the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>compass of this world’s history,—the history of human
transgression and suffering, of divine sacrifice, and of
victory over death and sin. Not all the conditions of
that first school of Eden will be found in the school
of the future life. No tree of knowledge of good and
evil will afford opportunity for temptation. No tempter
is there, no possibility of wrong. Every character has
withstood the testing of evil, and none are longer susceptible
to its power.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To him that overcometh,” Christ says, “will I give
to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the
paradise of God.”<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c015'><sup>[418]</sup></a> The giving of the tree of life in
Eden was conditional, and it was finally withdrawn.
But the gifts of the future life are absolute and eternal.</p>

<p class='c014'>The prophet beholds the “river of water of life,
clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God
and of the Lamb.” “And on this side of the river
and on that was the tree of life.” “And there shall
be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain; for the former things
are passed away.”<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c015'><sup>[419]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Restored to His presence, man will again, as at the

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>Unto Living Fountains</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“These are they which came out of great tribulation,
and have washed their robes, and made them white in
the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the
throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His
temple.... They shall hunger no more, neither
thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them,
nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of
the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto
living fountains of waters.”<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c015'><sup>[423]</sup></a></p>

even as also we are known.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c015'><sup>[424]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“They shall see His face; and His name shall be in

<div class='sidenote'><i>Field of Nature</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There, when the veil that darkens our vision shall
be removed, and our eyes shall behold that world of
beauty of which we now catch glimpses through the
microscope; when we look on the glories of the heavens,
now scanned afar through the telescope; when, the
blight of sin removed, the whole earth shall appear “in
the beauty of the Lord our God,” what a field will be
open to our study! There the student of science may
read the records of creation, and discern no reminders of
the law of evil. He may listen to the music of nature’s
voices, and detect no note of wailing or undertone of
sorrow. In all created things he may trace one handwriting,—in
the vast universe behold “God’s name writ
large,” and not in earth or sea or sky one sign of ill
remaining.</p>

<p class='c014'>There the Eden life will be lived, the life in garden
and field. “They shall build houses, and inhabit them;
and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>not plant, and another eat; for as the days of a tree are
the days of My people, and Mine elect shall long enjoy
the work of their hands.”<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c015'><sup>[426]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Kingship Restored</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There shall be nothing to “hurt nor destroy in all
My holy mountain, saith the Lord.”<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c015'><sup>[427]</sup></a> There man will
be restored to his lost kingship, and the lower order
of beings will again recognize his sway; the fierce will
become gentle, and the timid trustful.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Field of History</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There will be open to the student history of infinite
scope and of wealth inexpressible. Here, from the
vantage-ground of God’s word, the student is afforded
a view of the vast field of history, and may gain some
knowledge of the principles that govern the course of
human events. But his vision is still clouded, and his
knowledge incomplete. Not until he stands in the light
of eternity will he see all things clearly.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Great Controversy</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Then will be opened before him the course of the
great conflict that had its birth before time began, and
that ends only when time shall cease. The history of
the inception of sin; of fatal falsehood in its crooked
working; of truth that, swerving not from its own
straight lines, has met and conquered error,—all will
be made manifest. The veil that interposes between
the visible and the invisible world will be drawn aside,
and wonderful things will be revealed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not until the providences of God are seen in the
light of eternity shall we understand what we owe
to the care and interposition of His angels. Celestial
beings have taken an active part in the affairs of men.
They have appeared in garments that shone as the
lightning; they have come as men, in the garb of
wayfarers. They have accepted the hospitalities of
human homes; they have acted as guides to benighted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>travelers. They have thwarted the spoiler’s purpose,
and turned aside the stroke of the destroyer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Angel Ministry</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Though the rulers of this world know it not, yet
often in their councils angels have been spokesmen.
Human eyes have looked upon them. Human ears
have listened to their appeals. In the council-hall and
the court of justice, heavenly messengers have pleaded
the cause of the persecuted and oppressed. They have
defeated purposes and arrested evils that would have
brought wrong and suffering to God’s children. To
the students in the heavenly school, all this will be
unfolded.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every redeemed one will understand the ministry
of angels in his own life. The angel who was his
guardian from his earliest moment; the angel who
watched his steps, and covered his head in the day of
peril; the angel who was with him in the valley of the
shadow of death, who marked his resting-place, who
was the first to greet him in the resurrection-morning,—what
will it be to hold converse with him, and to learn
the history of divine interposition in the individual life,
of heavenly co-operation in every work for humanity!</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Perplexities Made Plain</i></div>

<p class='c014'>All the perplexities of life’s experience will then be
made plain. Where to us have appeared only confusion
and disappointment, broken purposes and thwarted
plans, will be seen a grand, overruling, victorious purpose,
a divine harmony.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Fruition of Life’s Sowing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There all who have wrought with unselfish spirit
will behold the fruit of their labors. The outworking
of every right principle and noble deed will be seen.
Something of this we see here. But how little of the
result of the world’s noblest work is in this life manifest
to the doer! How many toil unselfishly and unweariedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>for those who pass beyond their reach and knowledge!
Parents and teachers lie down in their last sleep, their
life-work seeming to have been wrought in vain; they
know not that their faithfulness has unsealed springs of
blessing that can never cease to flow; only by faith they
see the children they have trained become a benediction
and an inspiration to their fellow-men, and the influence
repeat itself a thousandfold. Many a worker sends out
into the world messages of strength and hope and courage,
words that carry blessing to hearts in every land;
but of the results he, toiling in loneliness and obscurity,
knows little. So gifts are bestowed, burdens are borne,
labor is done. Men sow the seed from which, above
their graves, others reap blessed harvests. They plant
trees, that others may eat the fruit. They are content
here to know that they have set in motion agencies for
good. In the hereafter the action and reaction of all
these will be seen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Heavenly Record</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Of every gift that God has bestowed, leading men to
unselfish effort, a record is kept in heaven. To trace
this in its wide-spreading lines, to look upon those
who by our efforts have been uplifted and ennobled,
to behold in their history the outworking of true principles,—this
will be one of the studies and rewards of
the heavenly school.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Social Life</i></div>

<p class='c014'>There we shall know even as also we are known.
There the loves and sympathies that God has planted
in the soul will find truest and sweetest exercise. The
pure communion with holy beings, the harmonious
social life with the blessed angels and with the faithful
ones of all ages, the sacred fellowship that binds together
“the whole family in heaven and earth,”—all are among
the experiences of the hereafter.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>There will be music there, and song, such music and
song as, save in the visions of God, no mortal ear has
heard or mind conceived.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Music and Song</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“As well the singers as the players on instruments
shall be there.”<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c015'><sup>[428]</sup></a> “They shall lift up their voice, they
shall sing for the majesty of Jehovah.”<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c015'><sup>[429]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“For the Lord shall comfort Zion; He will comfort
all her waste places; and He will make her wilderness
like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord;
joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving,
and the voice of melody.”<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c015'><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>There every power will be developed, every capability
increased. The grandest enterprises will be carried forward,
the loftiest aspirations will be reached, the highest
ambitions realized. And still there will arise new
heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths
to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of
body and mind and soul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Treasures of the Universe</i></div>

<p class='c014'>All the treasures of the universe will be open to the
study of God’s children. With unutterable delight we
shall enter into the joy and the wisdom of unfallen
beings. We shall share the treasures gained through
ages upon ages spent in contemplation of God’s handiwork.
And the years of eternity, as they roll, will
continue to bring more glorious revelations. “Exceeding
abundant above all that we ask or think”<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c015'><sup>[431]</sup></a> will be,
forever and forever, the impartation of the gifts of God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Service</i></div>

<p class='c014'>“His servants shall serve Him.”<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c015'><sup>[432]</sup></a> The life on earth
is the beginning of the life in heaven; education on earth
is an initiation into the principles of heaven; the life-work
here is a training for the life-work there. What
we now are, in character and holy service, is the sure
foreshadowing of what we shall be.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“The Son of man came not to be ministered unto,
but to minister.”<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c015'><sup>[433]</sup></a> Christ’s work below is His work
above, and our reward for working with Him in this
world will be the greater power and wider privilege of
working with Him in the world to come.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am
God.”<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c015'><sup>[434]</sup></a> This also we shall be in eternity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Witnessing</i></div>

<p class='c014'>For what was the great controversy permitted to
continue throughout the ages? Why was it that
Satan’s existence was not cut short at the outset of
his rebellion?—It was that the universe might be
convinced of God’s justice in His dealing with evil;
that sin might receive eternal condemnation. In the
plan of redemption there are heights and depths that
eternity itself can never exhaust, marvels into which
the angels desire to look. The redeemed only, of all
created beings, have in their own experience known the
actual conflict with sin; they have wrought with Christ,
and, as even the angels could not do, have entered into
the fellowship of His sufferings; will they have no testimony
as to the science of redemption,—nothing that
will be of worth to unfallen beings?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>The Glory of This Mystery</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>Even now, “unto the principalities and the powers
in the heavenly places” is “made known through the
church the manifold wisdom of God.” And He “hath
raised us up together, and made us sit together in
heavenly places;&nbsp;... that in the ages to come
He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in
His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.”<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c015'><sup>[435]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“In His temple doth every one speak of His
glory,”<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c015'><sup>[436]</sup></a> and the song which the ransomed ones will
sing,—the song of their experience,—will declare the
glory of God: “Great and marvelous are Thy works,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are
Thy ways, Thou King of the ages. Who shall not
fear, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? for Thou only
art holy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In our life here, earthly, sin-restricted, though it is,
the greatest joy and the highest education are in service.
And in the future state, untrammeled by the limitations
of sinful humanity, it is in service that our greatest joy
and our highest education will be found;—witnessing,
and ever as we witness learning anew “the riches of
the glory of this mystery;” “which is Christ in you,
the hope of glory.”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c014'>“It doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we
know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him;
for we shall see Him as He is.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“<i>He Shall Be Satisfied</i>”</div>

<p class='c014'>Then, in the results of His work, Christ will behold
its recompense. In that great multitude which no man
could number, presented “faultless before the presence
of His glory with exceeding joy,” He whose blood has
redeemed and whose life has taught us, “shall see of
the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>AN EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM FOR CHRISTIANS</div>
    <div class='c005'>By <span class='sc'>E. A. Sutherland</span></div>
    <div class='c005'>Is a history of education showing the responsibility placed upon parents and</div>
    <div>upon the church in all ages to provide for the spiritual training of the</div>
    <div>children. It advocates a threefold education, the only means of</div>
    <div>developing a perfect character. By repeated reference to leading</div>
    <div>educators, it shows that each generation has produced advocates</div>
    <div>of educational reform. The present duty of</div>
    <div>Christian parents and teachers is clearly indicated.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“I have read ‘Living Fountains’ with care. It is an excellent work, and
the best presentation of educational reform in the truest sense, which I have
seen. I wish it might be in every family. It should be carefully studied as a
text-book by parents and by all who have to do with children.”—J. H.
Kellogg, M. D., Battle Creek Sanitarium.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have carefully read ‘Living Fountains.’ The book sets forth the
principles and the history of true education, together with the growth of
Protestantism. I wish it could be placed in the hands of every family. It
shows the absolute necessity of making the Bible the foundation of Christian
education. I recommend it to all.”—S. N. Haskell, New York City.</p>

<p class='c014'>“After carefully reading ‘Living Fountains,’ I wish to bear testimony to
the fact that it has opened my eyes to the dangers in the present educational
system, of which I have been but dimly conscious, and to which, like many
others, I have given indifferent heed. In my judgment, ‘Living Fountains’
is a strong book, presenting a masterly array of facts to sustain the positions
taken, and suggesting a remedy that can not fail to commend itself to every
candid thinker. I believe it will do great good.”—Rev. F. A. Harter,
Webster City, Iowa.</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Living Fountains’ has been a great blessing to me, and has brought
me nearer to God. Every teacher who wishes to become a representative of
Christian education, should study this book. Parents should read it that
they may know their duty toward their children.”—John Lipke, Principal of
the Industrial Academy, Brusque, Bra.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am using ‘Living Fountains’ in my class work, and I am very much
pleased with it. It is a book that should be read by all.”—Frederick Griggs,
South Lancaster Academy, South Lancaster, Mass.</p>

<p class='c014'>It records the <i>Progress of Educational Movements</i> in the
world. Ministers, as leaders of the people, should understand
educational reform movements.</p>

both the principles and the methods of Christian education.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
